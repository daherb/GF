DESCRIPTION

The Grammatical Framework (=GF) is a grammar formalism based on type theory. 
It consists of

    * a special-purpose programming language
    * a compiler of the language
    * a generic grammar processor 

The compiler reads GF grammars from user-provided files, and the 
generic grammar processor performs various tasks with the grammars:

    * generation
    * parsing
    * translation
    * type checking
    * computation
    * paraphrasing
    * random generation
    * syntax editing 

GF particularly addresses two aspects of grammars:

    * multilinguality (parallel grammars for different languages)
    * semantics (semantic conditions of well-formedness, semantic 
      properties of expressions)
