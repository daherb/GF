10.15 installed Swe and Eng from package, tried them.

10.25 started Fin.

11.15 Finnish modules completed from Eng modules, start testing.
  optimize=noexpand necessary in GodisLangEng.
  Some decisions feel wrong: it seems the parametrized implementation
  cannot be fully used. Find some probable bugs in Eng as well.

11.45 Have to add VPI to ExtraFin.

12.00 TramSystemFin compiles. And compiles. And compiles. Going to lunch and a
  talk.

14.30 Back from lunch and talk. TramSystemFin has compiled in 15 minutes.
  Running with random examples, mostly OK Finnish. Thus a "baseline" was
  accomplished in 2 hours.


15.00 Change the inflection of stop names that end with a vowel. Convers
  all Finnish files to iso-latin-1 to conform with the resource library.
  After some forking, comment out the linearization of issue and fail in
  GodisSystemFin - the two functions that took the most time to compile.
  Now TramSystemFin compiles in 2.5 minutes.

15.50 TramUserFin also compiles, and even the parser works very well
  here. But errors in the grammar get evident. Fixed some by renaming
  the Finnish instance of TramUserI to TramUserFin0, and defining
  TramUserFin by subtracting from this.
