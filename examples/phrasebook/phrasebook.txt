Want to contribute? You can add [missing words missing.txt] by using the
[morphological paradigms http://www.grammaticalframework.org/lib/doc/synopsis.html#toc78].
The words are added to the ``Words``//L//``.gf`` files for each language //L//. Then recompile the
phrasebook by ``make``. All this of course in the
[source directory http://code.haskell.org/gf/examples/phrasebook/],
which you can obtain by 
[GF Darcs http://www.grammaticalframework.org/doc/gf-developers.html].

=Purpose=

This phrasebook is a programme for translating touristic phrases 
between 15 European languages:
- Bulgarian, Catalan, Danish, Dutch, English,
  Finnish, French, German, Italian, Norwegian,
  Polish, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish


It is implemented by using the GF programming language 
([Grammatical Framework http://grammaticalframework.org]).
It is the first demo for the MOLTO project 
([Multilingual On-Line Translation http://www.molto-project.eu]).

The phrasebook has the following requirements:
- high quality: reliable translations
- translation from any language to any other ones
- runnable in web browsers
- runnable on mobile phones (also off-line: forthcoming for Android phones)
- easily extensible by new words (forthcoming: semi-automatic extensions by users)


The phrasebook is available as open-source software, licensed under GNU LGPL. 
The source code resides in 
[``code.haskell.org/gf/examples/phrasebook/`` http://code.haskell.org/gf/examples/phrasebook/]


Current status (28 March 2010):
- available in English, Finnish, French, Italian, Romanian, Swedish
- very small coverage
- works on web browsers calling a server
- web service not yet released, but preliminarily available

=Points illustrated=

The use of resource grammars and functors.

Compile-time transfer: especially, in Action in Words.

Quasi-incremental translation: many basic types are also used as phrases.

Disambiguation, esp. by the parameters in Roles.


=Files=

``Sentences``: general syntactic structures implementable by 
functor. Concrete syntax via ``SencencesI``.


``Words``: words and predicates, typically language-dependent. Separate
concrete syntaxes.


``Greetings``: idiomatic phrases, string-based. Separate concrete
syntaxes.


``Phrasebook``: the top module putting everything together. Separate
concrete syntaxes.


Resource ``Roles``: parameter types Politeness, Gender

Interface ``DiffPhrasebook``: the (so far small) interface for Sentences.





=To Do=

Text-based translation interface.

Access to disambiguation grammars in the interface.

The remaining 10 languages

Extract/construct lexica for
- food stuff
- languages
- places


Connection to Google translate, for fall-back and for comparison

Feedback facility in the UI.
