==Installation instructions==

The Windows package is installed by just unpacking it anywhere. It finds the libraries
relative to the ``.exe`` file.

To install a binary package for Linux and Mac OS X:
+ uncompress the package by ``tar -xfz``
+ ``cd`` to the created directory
+ ``./configure``
+ ``make install``


The Mac OS X binary (Intel) requires Readline from
[Mac Ports http://www.macports.org/]. To install, see above item.

To compile and install from source: 
```
  tar xvfz gf-3.0beta.tgz
  cd GF/src
  autoconf
  ./configure
  make
  make install
```
To install the libraries (if done separately), unpack them in the place to which your
``GF_LIB_PATH`` points.
```
  cd $GF_LIB_PATH
  gtar xvfz gf-lib-1.4.tgz
```
If this variable hasn't been defined, it is useful define it, e.g.
```
  export GF_LIB_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gf/
```
