==Installation instructions==

The MacOS packages are installed by clicking at the icons, as usual.

The Windows package is installed by just unpacking it anywhere. 
It finds the libraries relative to the ``.exe`` file.

To install a binary package for Linux: uncompress the package by ``tar -xfz``


To compile and install from source on Mac or Linux, do:
```
  tar xvfz gf-[VERSION].tgz
  cd GF/src
  runghc Setup configure --user
  runghc Setup build
  runghc Setup install
```
The last command must be prefixed by ``sudo``, if the installation is outside
user-writeable area.

To install the libraries (if done separately), unpack them in the place to which your
``GF_LIB_PATH`` points.
```
  cd $GF_LIB_PATH
  gtar xvfz gf-lib-[VERSION].tgz
```
If this variable hasn't been defined, it is useful define it, e.g.
```
  export GF_LIB_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gf/
```
