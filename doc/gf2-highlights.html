<h2>Syntax of GF</h2>

An accurate <a href="DocGF.pdf">language specification</a> is now available.


<h2>Summary of novelties</h2>

<h4>Module system</h4>

<li> Separate modules for <tt>abstract</tt>, 
     <tt>concrete</tt>, and <tt>resource</tt>.
<li> Replaces the file-based <tt>include</tt> system
<li> Name space handling with qualified names
<li> Hierarchic structure (single inheritance <tt>**</tt>) + 
     cross-cutting reuse (<tt>open</tt>)
<li> Separate compilation, one module per file
<li> Reuse of <tt>abstract</tt>+<tt>concrete</tt> as <tt>resource</tt>
<li> Parametrized modules:
     <tt>interface</tt>, <tt>instance</tt>, <tt>incomplete</tt>.
<li> New experimental module types: <tt>transfer</tt>, 
     <tt>union</tt>.


<h4>Canonical format GFC</h4>

<li> The target of GF compiler; to reuse, just read in
<li> Readable by Haskell/Java/C++/C applications


<h4>New features in expression language</h4>

<li> Disjunctive patterns <tt>P | ... | Q</tt>.
<li> String patterns <tt>"foo"</tt>.
<li> Binding token <tt>&+</tt> to glue separate tokens at unlexing phase, 
     and unlexer to resolve this.
<li> New syntax alternatives for local definitions: <tt>let</tt> without
     braces and <tt>where</tt>.
<li> Pattern variables can be used on lhs's of <tt>oper</tt> definitions.
<li> New Unicode transliterations (by Harad Hammarström).


<h4>New shell commands and command functionalities</h4>

<li> <tt>pi</tt> = <tt>print_info</tt>: information on an identifier in scope.
<li> <tt>h</tt> = <tt>help</tt> now in long or short form, 
     and on individual commands.
<li> <tt>gt</tt> = <tt>generate_trees</tt>: all trees of a given
     category or instantiations of a given incomplete term, up to a
     given depth.
<li> <tt>gr</tt> = <tt>generate_random</tt> can now be given
     an incomplete term as an argument, to constrain generation.
<li> <tt>so</tt> = <tt>show_opers</tt> shows all <tt>ope</tt>
     operations with a given value type.
<li> <tt>pm</tt> = <tt>print_multi</tt> prints the multilingual
     grammar resident in the current state to a ready-compiles
     <tt>.gfcm</tt> file.
<li> All commands have both long and short names (see help). Short
     names are easier to type, whereas long names
     make scripts more readable.
<li> Meaningless command options generate warnings.


<h4>New editor features</h4>

<li> Active text field: click the middle button in the focus to send
     in refinement through the parser.
<li> Clipboard: copy complex terms into the refine menu.


<h4>Improved implementation</h4>

<li> Haskell source code is organized into subdirectories.
<li> BNF Converter is used for defining the languages GF and GFC, which also
     give reliable LaTeX documentation.
<li> Lexical rules sorted out by option <tt>-cflexer</tt> for efficient
     parsing with large lexica.     
<li> GHC optimizations and strictness flags are used for improving performance.


<h4>New parser (work in progress)</h4>

<li> By Peter Ljunglöf, based on MCFG.
<li> Much more efficient for morphology and discontinuous constituents.
<li> Treatment of cyclic rules.

<h2>Status (18/6/2004)</h2>

Grammar compiler, editor GUIs, and shell work for all platforms
(with restrictions for Solaris).

<p>

The updated <tt>HelpFile</tt> (accessible through <tt>h</tt> command)
marks unsupported features present in GF 1.2 with <tt>*</tt>.
They will be supported again if interested users appear.

<p>

GF1 grammars can be automatically translated to GF2 (although the
result is not as good
as manual, since indentation and comments are destroyed). The results can be 
saved in GF2 files, but this is not necessary. 
Some rarely used GF1 features are no longer supported (see next section).

<p>

It is also possible to write a GF2 grammar back to GF1, with the
command <tt>pg -printer=old</tt>.


<p>

Resource libraries 
and some example grammars and have been
converted. Most old example grammars work without any changes.
There is a new resource API with
many new constructions.

<p>

A make facility works, finding out which modules have to be recompiled.

<p>

Soundness checking of module depencencies and completeness is not
complete. This means that some errors may show up too late.

<p>

Latex and XML printing of grammars do not work yet.

<h2>How to use GF 1.* files</h2>

Backward compatibility with respect to old GF grammars has been
a central goal. All GF grammars, from version 0.9, should work in
the old way in GF2. The main exceptions are some features that 
are rarely used. 
<ul>
<li> The <tt>package</tt> system introduced in GF 1.2, cannot be
     interpreted in the module system of GF 2.0, since packages are in
     mutual scope with the top level.
<li> <tt>tokenizer</tt> pragmas are cannot be parsed any more. In GF
     1.2, they are already replaced by <tt>lexer</tt> flags.
<li> <tt>var</tt> pragmas cannot be parsed any more.
</ul>

<p>

Very old GF grammars (from versions before 0.9), with the completely
different notation, do not work. They should be first converted to 
GF1 by using GF version 1.2.

<p>

The import command <tt>i</tt> can be given the option <tt>-old</tt>. E.g.
<pre>
  i -old tut1.Eng.g2
</pre>
But this is no more necessary: GF2 detects automatically if a grammar
is in the GF1 format.

<p>

Importing a set of GF2 files generates, internally, three modules:
<pre>
  abstract tut1 = ...
  resource ResEng = ...
  concrete Eng of tut1 = open ResEng in ...
</pre>
(The names are different if the file name has fewer parts.)


<p>

The option <tt>-o</tt> causes GF2 to write these modules into files.

<p>

The flags <tt>-abs</tt>, <tt>-cnc</tt>, and <tt>-res</tt> can be used
to give custom names to the modules. In particular, it is good to use
the <tt>-abs</tt> flag to guarantee that the abstract syntax module
has the same name for all grammars in a multilingual environmens:
<pre>
  i -old -abs=Numerals hungarian.gf
  i -old -abs=Numerals tamil.gf
  i -old -abs=Numerals sanskrit.gf
</pre>

<p>

The same flags as in the import command can be used when invoking
GF2 from the system shell. Many grammars can be imported on the same command
line, e.g.
<pre>
  % gf2 -old -abs=Tutorial tut1.Eng.gf tut1.Fin.gf tut1.Fra.gf
</pre>

<p>

To write a GF2 grammar back to GF1 (as one big file), use the command
<pre>
  > pg -old
</pre>


<p>


GF2 has more reserved words than GF 1.2. When old files are read, a preprocessor
replaces every identifier that has the shape of a new reserved word
with a variant where the last letter is replaced by <tt>Z</tt>, e.g.
<tt>instance</tt> is replaced by <tt>instancZ</tt>. This method is of course
unsafe and should be replaced by something better.

<h2>Abstract, concrete, and resource modules</h2>

Judgement forms are sorted as follows:
<ul>
<li> abstract: 
  <tt>cat</tt>, <tt>fun</tt>, <tt>def</tt>, <tt>data</tt>, <tt>flags</tt>
<li> concrete: 
  <tt>lincat</tt>, <tt>cat</tt>, <tt>printname</tt>, <tt>flags</tt>
<li> resource: 
  <tt>param</tt>, <tt>oper</tt>, <tt>flags</tt>
<li> 
</ul>
Example:
<pre>
  abstract Sums = {
    cat 
      Exp ;
    fun 
      One : Exp ;
      plus : Exp -> Exp -> Exp ;
  }

  concrete EnglishSums of Sums = open ResEng in {
    lincat 
      Exp = {s : Str ; n : Number} ;
    lin
      One = expSg "one" ;
      sum x y = expSg ("the" ++ "sum" ++ "of" ++ x.s ++ "and" ++ y.s) ;
  }

  resource ResEng = {
    param 
      Number = Sg | Pl ;
    oper 
      expSG : Str -> {s : Str ; n : Number} = \s -> {s = s ; n = Sg} ;
  }
</pre>



<!-- NEW -->

<h2>Opening and extending modules</h2>

A <tt>concrete</tt> or <tt>resource</tt> can <b>open</b> a
<tt>resource</tt>. This means that
<ul>
<li> the names defined in <tt>resource</tt> can be used ("become visible")
<li> but: these names are not included in ("exported from") the opening module
</ul>
A module of any type can moreover <b>extend</b> a module of the same type.
This means that
<ul>
<li> the names defined in the extended module can be used ("become visible")
<li> and also: these names are included in ("exported from") the extending module
</ul>
Examples of extension:
<pre>
  abstract Products = Sums ** {
    fun times : Exp -> Exp -> Exp ;
  }
  -- names exported: Exp, plus, times

  concrete English of Products = EnglishSums ** open ResEng in {
    lin times x y = expSg ("the" ++ "product" ++ "of" ++ x.s ++ "and" ++ y.s) ;
  }
</pre>
Another important difference:
<li> extension is single
<li> opening can be multiple: <tt>open Foo, Bar, Baz in {...}</tt>

<p>

Moreover:
<li> opening can be <b>qualified</b>
<p>
Example of qualified opening:
<pre>
  concrete NumberSystems of Systems = open (Bin = Binary), (Dec = Decimal) in {
    lin 
      BZero = Bin.Zero ;
      DZero = Dec.Zero
  }
</pre>
  

<!-- NEW -->

<h2>Compiling modules</h2>

Separate compilation assumes there is <b>one module per file</b>.

<p>

The <b>module header</b> is the beginning of the module code up to the
first left bracket (<tt>{</tt>). The header gives
<ul>
<li> the module type: <tt>abstract</tt>, <tt>concrete</tt> (<tt>of</tt> <i>A</i>), 
  or <tt>resource</tt>
<li> the name of the module (next to the module type keyword)
<li> the name of extended module (between <tt>=</tt> and <tt>**</tt>)
<li> the names of opened modules
</ul>

<p>

<b>filename</b> = <b>modulename</b> <tt>.</tt> <b>extension</b>

<p>

File name extensions:
<ul>
<li> <tt>gf</tt>: GF source file (uses GF syntax, is type checked and compiled)
<li> <tt>gfc</tt>: canonical GF file (uses GFC syntax, is simply read
in instead of compiled; produced from all kinds of modules)
<li> <tt>gfr</tt>: GF resource file (uses GF syntax, is only read in; produced from
<tt>resource</tt> modules)
<li> <tt>gfcm</tt>: canonical multilingual GF file 
(uses GFC syntax, is only read in; produced 
from a set of <tt>abstract</tt> and <tt>conctrete</tt> modules)
</ul>
Only <tt>gf</tt> files should ever be written/edited manually!

<p>

What the make facility does when compiling <tt>Foo.gf</tt>
<ol>
<li> read the module header of <tt>Foo.gf</tt>, and recursively all headers from
the modules it <b>depends</b> on (i.e. extends or opens) 
<li> build a dependency graph of these modules, and do topological sorting
<li> starting from the first module in topological order,
compare the modification times of each <tt>gf</tt> and <tt>gfc</tt> file:
<ul>
<li> if <tt>gf</tt> is later, compile the module and all modules depending on it
<li> if <tt>gfc</tt> is later, just read in the module
</ul>
</ol>
Inside the GF shell, also time stamps of modules read into memory are
taken into account. Thus a module need not be read from a file if the
module is in the memory and the file has not been modified.

<p>

If the compilation of a grammar fails at some module, the state of the
GF shell contains all modules read up to that point. This makes it
faster to compile the faulty module again after fixing it.

<p>

Use the command <tt>po</tt> = <tt>print_options</tt> to see what
modules are in the state.

<p>

To force compilation:
<ul>
<li> The flag <i>-src</i> in the import command forces compilation from
     source even if more recent object files exist. This is useful
     when testing new versions of GF.
<li> The flag <i>-retain</i> in the import command forces reading in
     <tt>gfr</tt> files in addition to <tt>gfc</tt> files. This is useful
     when testing operations with the <tt>cc</tt> command.
</ul>

<!-- NEW -->

<h2>Module search paths</h2>

Modules can reside in different directories. Use the <tt>path</tt>
flag to extend the directory search path. For instance,
<pre>
  -path=.:../resource/russian:../prelude
</pre>
enables files to be found in three different directories.
By default, only the current directory is included.
If a <tt>path</tt> flag is given, the current directory
<tt>.</tt> must be explicitly included if it is wanted.

<p>

The <tt>path</tt> flag can be set in any of the following
places:
<ul>
<li> when invoking GF: <tt>gf -path=xxx</tt>
<li> when importing a module: <tt>i -path=xxx Foo.gf</tt>
<li> as a pragma in a topmost file: <tt>--# -path=xxx</tt>
</ul>
A flag set on a command line overrides ones set in files.
