<P>
<B>WARNING: The Transfer language is still experimental. Its syntax, type system and semantics may change without notice. I will try to help you with any problems this might cause, but I will not refrain from changing the language solely for reasons of backwards compatibility.</B>
</P>
<A NAME="toc1"></A>
<H1>Objective</H1>
<P>
We want to write a Transfer program which we can use to do aggregation
in sentences which use conjunctions on the sentence, noun phrase and
verb phrase levels. For example, we want to be able to transform
the sentence "John walks and Mary walks" to the sentence 
"John and Mary walk". We would also like to transform 
"John walks and John swims" to "John walks and swims". 
</P>
<P>
Thus that what we want to do is:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Transform sentence conjunction where the verb phrases in the sentences
  are identical to noun phrase conjunction.
<LI>Transform sentence conjunction where the noun phrases in the sentences
  are identical to verb phrase conjunction.
</UL>

<P>
This needs to be done recursively and thoughout the sentence, to be 
able to handle cases like "John walks and Mary walks and Bill walks", and
"John runs and Mary walks and Bill walks".
</P>
<P>
FIXME: what about John walks and Mary runs and Bill walks"?
</P>
<A NAME="toc2"></A>
<H1>Abstract syntax</H1>
<P>
We will use the abstract syntax defined in 
<A HREF="../transfer/examples/aggregation/Abstract.gf">Abstract.gf</A>.
</P>
<A NAME="toc3"></A>
<H1>Concrete syntax</H1>
<P>
There is an English concrete syntax for this grammar in
<A HREF="../transfer/examples/aggregation/English.gf">English.gf</A>.
</P>
<A NAME="toc4"></A>
<H1>Generate tree module</H1>
<P>
To be able to write Transfer programs which use the types defined in
an abstract syntax, we first need to generate a Transfer file with
a data type defintition corresponding to the abstract syntax.
This is done with the <CODE>transfer</CODE> grammar printer:
</P>
<PRE>
  $ gf
  &gt; i English.gf
  &gt; pg -printer=transfer | wf tree.tra
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>
Note that you need to load a concrete syntax which uses the abstract
syntax that you want to create a Transfer data type for. Loading just the
abstract syntax module is not enough. FIXME: why?
</P>
<P>
The command sequence above writes a Transfer data type definition to the
file <A HREF="../transfer/examples/aggregation/tree.tra">tree.tra</A>.
</P>
<A NAME="toc5"></A>
<H1>Write transfer code</H1>
<P>
We write the Transfer program 
<A HREF="../transfer/examples/aggregation/aggregate.tra">aggregate.tra</A>.
</P>
<P>
FIXME: explain the code
</P>
<A NAME="toc6"></A>
<H1>Compiling Transfer programs</H1>
<P>
Transfer programs are written in the human-friendly Transfer language,
but GF only understands the simpler Transfer Core language. Therefore,
before using a Transfer program, you must first compile it to
Transfer Core. This is done using the <CODE>transferc</CODE> command:
</P>
<PRE>
  $ transferc -i&lt;lib&gt; &lt;transfer program&gt;
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>
Here, <CODE>&lt;lib&gt;</CODE> is the path to search for any modules which you import
in your Transfer program. You can give several <CODE>-i</CODE> flags.
</P>
<P>
So, to compile <CODE>aggregate.tra</CODE> which we created above, we use:
</P>
<PRE>
  $ transferc aggregate.tra
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>
The creates the Transfer Core file <CODE>aggregate.trc</CODE>.
</P>
<A NAME="toc7"></A>
<H1>Using Transfer programs in GF</H1>
<A NAME="toc8"></A>
<H2>Loading the grammars</H2>
<P>
To use a Transfer Core program to transform abstract syntax terms
in GF, you must first load the grammars which you want to use the
program with. For the example above, we need the grammar <CODE>English.gf</CODE>
and its dependencies. We load this grammar with:
</P>
<PRE>
  &gt; i English.gf
</PRE>
<P></P>
<A NAME="toc9"></A>
<H2>Loading the Transfer program</H2>
<P>
There are two steps to using a Transfer Core program in GF. First you load 
the program into GF. This is done with the <CODE>i</CODE> command, which is also
used when loading grammar modules. To load the <CODE>aggregate.trc</CODE> which
we created above, we use:
</P>
<PRE>
  &gt; i aggregate.trc
</PRE>
<P></P>
<A NAME="toc10"></A>
<H2>Calling Transfer functions</H2>
<P>
To call a Transfer function on a term, we use the <CODE>at</CODE> command.
The <CODE>at</CODE> command takes the name of a Transfer function and an abstract
syntax term, and applies the function to the term:
</P>
<PRE>
  &gt; at aggregS ConjS And (Pred John Walk) (Pred Mary Walk)
  
  Pred (ConjNP And John Mary) Walk
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>
Of course, the input and output terms of the <CODE>at</CODE> command can
be read from and written to pipes:
</P>
<PRE>
  &gt; p "John walks and Mary walks" | at aggregS | l
  
  John and Mary walk
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>
To see what is going on between the steps, we can use <CODE>-tr</CODE> flags
to the commands:
</P>
<PRE>
  &gt; p -tr "John walks and Mary walks" | at -tr aggregS | l
  
  ConjS And (Pred John Walk) (Pred Mary Walk)
  
  Pred (ConjNP And John Mary) Walk
  
  John and Mary walk
</PRE>
<P></P>
<A NAME="toc11"></A>
<H3>Transfer between different abstract syntaxes</H3>
<P>
If the transfer function which you wan to call takes as input a term in one
abstract syntax, and returns a term in a different abstract syntax, you
can use the <CODE>-lang</CODE> flag with the <CODE>at</CODE> command. This is needed since the 
<CODE>at</CODE> command type checks the result it produces, and it needs to
know which abstract sytnax to type check it in.
