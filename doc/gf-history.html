<h1>Grammatical Framework History of Changes</h1>



Changes in functionality since May 17, 2005, release of GF Version 2.2

</center>

27/6 (AR) The flag <tt>flags optimize=noexpand</tt> placed in a
resource module prevents the optimization phase of the compiler when
the <tt>.gfr</tt> file is created. This can prevent serious code
explosion, but it will also make the processing of modules using the
resource slowwer. A favourable example is <tt>lib/resource/finnish/ParadigmsFin</tt>.

<p>

23/6 (HD,AR) The new editor GUI <tt>gfeditor</tt> by Hans-Joachim
Daniels can now be used. It is based on Janna Khegai's <tt>jgf</tt>.
New functionality include HTML display (<tt>gfeditor -h</tt>) and
programmable refinement tooltips.

<p>

23/6 (AR) The flag <tt>unlexer=finnish</tt> can be used to bind
Finnish suffixes (e.g. possessives) to preceding words. The GF source
notation is e.g. <tt>"isä" ++ "&*" ++ "nsa" ++ "&*" ++ "ko"</tt>,
which unlexes to <tt>"isänsäkö"</tt>. There is no corresponding lexer
support yet.


<p>

22/6 (PL,AR) The MCFG parser (<tt>p -mcfg</tt>) now works on all
optimized grammars - hence you need not select a weaker optimization
to use this parser. The same concerns the CFGM printer (<tt>pm -printer=cfgm</tt>).

<p>

20/6 (AR) Added the command <tt>visualize_tree</tt> = <tt>vt</tt>, to
display syntax trees graphically. Like <tt>vg</tt>, this command uses
GraphViz and Ghostview. The foremost use is to pipe the parser to this
command.

<p>

17/6 (BB) There is now support for lists in GF abstract syntax.
A list category is declared as:
<pre>
cat [C]
</pre>
or
<pre>
cat [C]{n}
</pre>
where <tt>C</tt> is a category and <tt>n</tt> is a non-negative integer.
<tt>cat [C]</tt> is equivalent to <tt>cat [C]{0}</tt>. List category
syntax can be used whereever categories are used.

<p>

<tt>cat [C]{n}</tt> is equivalent to the declarations:
<pre>
cat ListC
fun BaseC : C^n -&gt; ListC
fun ConsC : C -&gt; ListC -&gt; ListC
</pre>

where <tt>C^0 -&gt; X</tt> means <tt>X</tt>, and <tt>C^m</tt> (where
m &gt; 0) means <tt>C -&gt; C^(m-1)</tt>.

<p>

A lincat declaration on the form:
<pre>
lincat [C] = T
</pre>
is equivalent to
<pre>
lincat ListC = T
</pre>

The linearizations of the list constructors are written
just like they would be if the function declarations above
had been made manually, e.g.:
<pre>
lin BaseC x_1 ... x_n = t
lin ConsC x xs = t'
</pre>

<p>

10/6 (AR) Preprocessor of <tt>.gfe</tt> files can now be performed as part of
any grammar compilation. The flag <tt>-ex</tt> causes GF to look for
the <tt>.gfe</tt> files and preprocess those that are younger
than the corresponding <tt>.gf</tt> files. The files are first sorted
and grouped by the resource, so that each resource only need be compiled once.

<p>

10/6 (AR) Editor GUI can now be alternatively invoked by the shell
command <tt>gf -edit</tt> (equivalent to <tt>jgf</tt>).

<p>

10/6 (AR) Editor GUI command <tt>pc Int</tt> to pop <tt>Int</tt>
items from the clip board.

<p>

4/6 (AR) Sequence of commands in the Java editor GUI now possible.
The commands are separated by <tt> ;; </tt> (notice the space on
both sides of the two semicolons). Such a sequence can be sent
from the "GF Command"  pop-up field, but is mostly intended
for external processes that communicate with GF.

<p>

3/6 (AR) The format <tt>.gfe</tt> defined to support
<b>grammar writing by examples</b>. Files of this format are first
converted to <tt>.gf</tt> files by the command
<pre>
  gf -examples File.gfe
</pre>
See <a href="../lib/resource/doc/example/QuestionsI.gfe">
<tt>../lib/resource/doc/examples/QuestionsI.gfe</tt></a>
for an example.

<p>

31/5 (AR) Default of p -rawtrees=k changed to 999999.

<p>

31/5 (AR) Support for restricted inheritance. Syntax:
<pre>
  M          -- inherit everything from M, as before
  M [a,b,c]  -- only inherit constants a,b,c
  M-[a,b,c]  -- inherit everything except a,b,c
</pre>
Caution: there is no check yet for completeness and
consistency, but restricted inheritance can create
run-time failures.

<p>

29/5 (AR) Parser support for reading GFC files line per line.
The category <tt>Line</tt> in <tt>GFC.cf</tt> can be used
as entrypoint instead of <tt>Grammar</tt> to achieve this.

<p>

28/5 (AR) Environment variables and path wild cards.
<ul>
<li> <tt>GF_LIB_PATH</tt> gives the location of <tt>GF/lib</tt>
<li> <tt>GF_GRAMMAR_PATH</tt> gives a list of directories appended
     to the explicitly given path
<li> <tt>DIR/*</tt> is expanded to the union of all subdirectories
     of <tt>DIR</tt>
</ul>
<p>


26/5/2005 (BB) Notation for list categories.
