<h1>Grammatical Framework History of Changes</h1>



Changes in functionality since May 17, 2005, release of GF Version 2.2

</center>

14/9 (AR) Added printing of grammars to a format without parameters, in
the spirit of Peanos "Latino sine flexione". The command <tt>pg -unpar</tt>
does the trick, and the result can be saved in a <tt>gfcm</tt> file. The generated
concrete syntax modules get the prefix <tt>UP_</tt>. The translation is briefly:
<pre>
  (P => T)*               =  T*
  (t ! p)*                =  t*
  (table {p => t ; ...})* =  t*
</pre>
In order for this to be maximally useful, the grammar should be written in such
a way that the first value of every parameter type is the desired one. For
instance, in Peano's case it would be the ablative for noun cases, the singular for
numbers, and the 2nd person singular imperative for verb forms.

<p>

14/9 (BB) Added finite state approximation of grammars. 
Internally the conversion is done <tt>cfg -&gt; regular -&gt; fa -&gt; slf</tt>, so the
different printers can be used to check the output of each stage.
The new options are:
<dl>
<dt><tt>pg -printer=slf</tt></dt>
<dd>A finite automaton in the HTK SLF format.</dd>
<dt><tt>pg -printer=slf_graphviz</tt></dt>
<dd>The same FA as in SLF, but in Graphviz format.</dd>
<dt><tt>pg -printer=fa_graphviz</tt></dt>
<dd>A finite automaton with labelled edges, instead of labelled nodes which SLF has.</dd>
<dt><tt>pg -printer=regular</tt></dt>
<dd>A regular grammar in a simple BNF.</dd>
</dl>

<p>

4/9 (AR) Added the option <tt>pg -printer=stat</tt> to show
statistics of gfc compilation result. To be extended with new information.
The most important stats now are the top-40 sized definitions.

<p>

1/7 <b>Release of GF 2.3</b>.

<p>


1/7 (AR) Added the flag <tt>-o</tt> to the <tt>vt</tt> command
to just write the <tt>.dot</tt> file without going to <tt>.ps</tt>
(cf. 20/6).

<p>

29/6 (AR) The printer used by Embedded Java GF Interpreter 
(<tt>pm -header</tt>) now produces
working code from all optimized grammars - hence you need not select a 
weaker optimization just to use the interpreter. However, the
optimization <tt>-optimize=share</tt> usually produces smaller object
grammars because the "unoptimizer" just undoes all optimizations.
(This is to be considered a temporary solution until the interpreter
knows how to handle stronger optimizations.)

<p>

27/6 (AR) The flag <tt>flags optimize=noexpand</tt> placed in a
resource module prevents the optimization phase of the compiler when
the <tt>.gfr</tt> file is created. This can prevent serious code
explosion, but it will also make the processing of modules using the
resource slowwer. A favourable example is <tt>lib/resource/finnish/ParadigmsFin</tt>.

<p>

23/6 (HD,AR) The new editor GUI <tt>gfeditor</tt> by Hans-Joachim
Daniels can now be used. It is based on Janna Khegai's <tt>jgf</tt>.
New functionality include HTML display (<tt>gfeditor -h</tt>) and
programmable refinement tooltips.

<p>

23/6 (AR) The flag <tt>unlexer=finnish</tt> can be used to bind
Finnish suffixes (e.g. possessives) to preceding words. The GF source
notation is e.g. <tt>"isä" ++ "&*" ++ "nsa" ++ "&*" ++ "ko"</tt>,
which unlexes to <tt>"isänsäkö"</tt>. There is no corresponding lexer
support yet.


<p>

22/6 (PL,AR) The MCFG parser (<tt>p -mcfg</tt>) now works on all
optimized grammars - hence you need not select a weaker optimization
to use this parser. The same concerns the CFGM printer (<tt>pm -printer=cfgm</tt>).

<p>

20/6 (AR) Added the command <tt>visualize_tree</tt> = <tt>vt</tt>, to
display syntax trees graphically. Like <tt>vg</tt>, this command uses
GraphViz and Ghostview. The foremost use is to pipe the parser to this
command.

<p>

17/6 (BB) There is now support for lists in GF abstract syntax.
A list category is declared as:
<pre>
cat [C]
</pre>
or
<pre>
cat [C]{n}
</pre>
where <tt>C</tt> is a category and <tt>n</tt> is a non-negative integer.
<tt>cat [C]</tt> is equivalent to <tt>cat [C]{0}</tt>. List category
syntax can be used whereever categories are used.

<p>

<tt>cat [C]{n}</tt> is equivalent to the declarations:
<pre>
cat ListC
fun BaseC : C^n -&gt; ListC
fun ConsC : C -&gt; ListC -&gt; ListC
</pre>

where <tt>C^0 -&gt; X</tt> means <tt>X</tt>, and <tt>C^m</tt> (where
m &gt; 0) means <tt>C -&gt; C^(m-1)</tt>.

<p>

A lincat declaration on the form:
<pre>
lincat [C] = T
</pre>
is equivalent to
<pre>
lincat ListC = T
</pre>

The linearizations of the list constructors are written
just like they would be if the function declarations above
had been made manually, e.g.:
<pre>
lin BaseC x_1 ... x_n = t
lin ConsC x xs = t'
</pre>

<p>

10/6 (AR) Preprocessor of <tt>.gfe</tt> files can now be performed as part of
any grammar compilation. The flag <tt>-ex</tt> causes GF to look for
the <tt>.gfe</tt> files and preprocess those that are younger
than the corresponding <tt>.gf</tt> files. The files are first sorted
and grouped by the resource, so that each resource only need be compiled once.

<p>

10/6 (AR) Editor GUI can now be alternatively invoked by the shell
command <tt>gf -edit</tt> (equivalent to <tt>jgf</tt>).

<p>

10/6 (AR) Editor GUI command <tt>pc Int</tt> to pop <tt>Int</tt>
items from the clip board.

<p>

4/6 (AR) Sequence of commands in the Java editor GUI now possible.
The commands are separated by <tt> ;; </tt> (notice the space on
both sides of the two semicolons). Such a sequence can be sent
from the "GF Command"  pop-up field, but is mostly intended
for external processes that communicate with GF.

<p>

3/6 (AR) The format <tt>.gfe</tt> defined to support
<b>grammar writing by examples</b>. Files of this format are first
converted to <tt>.gf</tt> files by the command
<pre>
  gf -examples File.gfe
</pre>
See <a href="../lib/resource/doc/example/QuestionsI.gfe">
<tt>../lib/resource/doc/examples/QuestionsI.gfe</tt></a>
for an example.

<p>

31/5 (AR) Default of p -rawtrees=k changed to 999999.

<p>

31/5 (AR) Support for restricted inheritance. Syntax:
<pre>
  M          -- inherit everything from M, as before
  M [a,b,c]  -- only inherit constants a,b,c
  M-[a,b,c]  -- inherit everything except a,b,c
</pre>
Caution: there is no check yet for completeness and
consistency, but restricted inheritance can create
run-time failures.

<p>

29/5 (AR) Parser support for reading GFC files line per line.
The category <tt>Line</tt> in <tt>GFC.cf</tt> can be used
as entrypoint instead of <tt>Grammar</tt> to achieve this.

<p>

28/5 (AR) Environment variables and path wild cards.
<ul>
<li> <tt>GF_LIB_PATH</tt> gives the location of <tt>GF/lib</tt>
<li> <tt>GF_GRAMMAR_PATH</tt> gives a list of directories appended
     to the explicitly given path
<li> <tt>DIR/*</tt> is expanded to the union of all subdirectories
     of <tt>DIR</tt>
</ul>
<p>


26/5/2005 (BB) Notation for list categories.
