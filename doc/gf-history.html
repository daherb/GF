<h1>Grammatical Framework History of Changes</h1>



Changes in functionality since May 17, 2005, release of GF Version 2.2

</center>

<p>

10/6 (AR) Preprocessor of <tt>.gfe</tt> files can now be performed as part of
any grammar compilation. The flag <tt>-ex</tt> causes GF to look for
the <tt>.gfe</tt> files and preprocess those that are younger
than the corresponding <tt>.gf</tt> files. The files are first sorted
and group by the resource, so that each resource only need be compiled once.

<p>

10/6 (AR) Editor GUI can now be alternatively invoked by the shell
command <tt>gf -edit</tt> (equivalent to <tt>jgf</tt>).

<p>

10/6 (AR) Editor GUI command <tt>pc Int</tt> to pop <tt>Int</tt>
items from the clip board.

<p>

4/6 (AR) Sequence of commands in the Java editor GUI now possible.
The commands are separated by <tt> ;; </tt> (notice the space on
both sides of the two semicolons). Such a sequence can be sent
from the "GF Command"  pop-up field, but is mostly intended
for external processes that communicate with GF.

<p>

3/6 (AR) The format <tt>.gfe</tt> defined to support
<b>grammar writing by examples</b>. Files of this format are first
converted to <tt>.gf</tt> files by the command
<pre>
  gf -examples File.gfe
</pre>
See <a href="../lib/resource/doc/example/QuestionsI.gfe">
<tt>../lib/resource/doc/examples/QuestionsI.gfe</tt></a>
for an example.

<p>

31/5 (AR) Default of p -rawtrees=k changed to 999999.

<p>

31/5 (AR) Support for restricted inheritance. Syntax:
<pre>
  M          -- inherit everything from M, as before
  M [a,b,c]  -- only inherit constants a,b,c
  M-[a,b,c]  -- inherit everything except a,b,c
</pre>
Caution: there is no check yet for completeness and
consistency, but restricted inheritance can create
run-time failures.

<p>

29/5 (AR) Parser support for reading GFC files line per line.
The category <tt>Line</tt> in <tt>GFC.cf</tt> can be used
as entrypoint instead of <tt>Grammar</tt> to achieve this.

<p>

28/5 (AR) Environment variables and path wild cards.
<ul>
<li> <tt>GF_LIB_PATH</tt> gives the location of <tt>GF/lib</tt>
<li> <tt>GF_GRAMMAR_PATH</tt> gives a list of directories appended
     to the explicitly given path
<li> <tt>DIR/*</tt> is expanded to the union of all subdirectories
     of <tt>DIR</tt>
</ul>
<p>


26/5/2005 (BB) Notation for list categories.
