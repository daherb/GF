<h1>Grammatical Framework History of Changes</h1>



Changes in functionality since May 17, 2005, release of GF Version 2.2

</center>

<p>

<hr>

22/12 (AR) <b>Release of GF version 2.7</b>.

21/12 (AR) 
Overloading rules for GF version 2.7:
<ol>
<li> If a unique instance is found by exact match with argument types,
  that instance is used.
<li> Otherwise, if exact match with the expected value type gives a
  uniques instance, that instance is used.
<li> Otherwise, if among possible instances only one returns a non-function
  type, that instance is used, but a warning is issued.
<li> Otherwise, an error results, and the list of possible instances is shown.
</ol>
These rules are still experimental, but all future developments will guarantee
that their type-correct use will work. Rule (3) is only needed because the 
current type checker does not always know an expected type. It can give
an incorrect result which is captured later in the compilation. To be noticed,
in particular, is that exact match is required. Match by subtyping will be
investigated later.

<p>

21/12 (BB) Java Speech Grammar Format with SISR tags can now be generated.
Use <tt>pg -printer=jsgf_sisr_old</tt>. The SISR tags are in Working Draft
20030401 format, which is supported by the OptimTALK VoiceXML interpreter
and the IBM XHTML+Voice implementation use by the Opera web browser.

<p>

21/12 (BB) <a name="voicexml">
VoiceXML 2.0 dialog systems can now be generated from GF grammars.
Use <tt>pg -printer=vxml</tt>.

<p>

21/12 (BB) <a name="javascript">
JavaScript code for linearization and type annotation can now be
generated from a multilingual GF grammar. Use <tt>pm -printer=js</tt>.


<p>

5/12 (BB) <a name="gfcc2c">
A new tool for generating C linearization libraries
from a GFCC file. <tt>make gfcc2c</tt> in <tt>src</tt>
compiles the tool. The generated
code includes header files in <tt>lib/c</tt> and should be linked
against <tt>libgfcc.a</tt> in <tt>lib/c</tt>. For an example of
using the generated code, see <tt>src/tools/c/examples/bronzeage</tt>.
<tt>make</tt> in that directory generates a GFCC file, then generates
C code from that, and then compiles a program <tt>bronzeage-test</tt>.
The <tt>main</tt> function for that program is defined in
<tt>bronzeage-test.c</tt>.


<p>

20/11 (AR) Type error messages in concrete syntax are printed with a
heuristic where a type of the form <tt>{... ; lock_C : {} ; ...}</tt>
is printed as <tt>C</tt>. This gives more readable error messages, but
can produce wrong results if lock fields are hand-written or if subtypes
of lock-fielded categories are used.

<p>

17/11 (AR) <a name="overloading">
Operation overloading: an <tt>oper</tt> can have many types,
from which one is picked at compile time. The types must have different
argument lists. Exact match with the arguments given to the <tt>oper</tt>
is required. An example is given in 
<a href="../lib/resource-1.0/doc/gfdoc/Constructors.gf"><tt>Constructors.gf</tt></a>.
The purpose of overloading is to make libraries easier to use, since
only one name for each grammatical operation is needed: predication, modification,
coordination, etc. The concrete syntax is, at this experimental level, not
extended but relies on using a record with the function name repeated
as label name (see the example). The treatment of overloading is inspired
by C++, and was first suggested by Björn Nringert.

<p>


3/10 (AR) A new low-level format <tt>gfcc</tt> ("Canonical Canonical GF").
It is going to replace the <tt>gfc</tt> format later, but is already now
an efficient format for multilingual generation.
See <a href="../src/GF/Canon/GFCC/doc/gfcc.html">GFCC document</a> 
for more information.

<p>

1/9 (AR) New way for managing errors in grammar compilation:
<pre>
  Predef.Error : Type ;
  Predef.error : Str -> Predef.Error ;
</pre>
Denotationally, <tt>Error</tt> is the empty type and thus a
subtype of any other types: it can be used anywhere. But the
<tt>error</tt> function is not canonical. Hence the compilation
is interrupted when <tt>(error s)</tt> is translated to GFC, and
the message <tt>s</tt> is emitted. An example use is given in
<tt>english/ParadigmsEng.gf</tt>:
<pre>
  regDuplV : Str -> V ;
  regDuplV fit = 
    case last fit of {
      ("a" | "e" | "i" | "o" | "u" | "y") => 
        Predef.error (["final duplication makes no sense for"] ++ fit) ;
      t =>
       let fitt = fit + t in
       mkV fit (fit + "s") (fitt + "ed") (fitt + "ed") (fitt + "ing")
      } ;
</pre>
This function thus cannot be applied to a stem ending with a vowel,
which is exactly what we want. In future, it may be good to add similar
checks to all morphological paradigms in the resource.


<p>

16/8 (AR) New generation  algorithm: slower but works with less
memory. Default of <tt>gt</tt>; use <tt>gt -mem</tt> for the old
algorithm. The new option <tt>gt -all</tt> lazily generates all 
trees until interrupted. It cannot be piped to other GF commands,
hence use <tt>gt -all -lin</tt> to print out linearized strings
rather than trees.

<hr>


22/6 (AR) <b>Release of GF version 2.6</b>.

<p>

20/6 (AR) The FCFG parser is know the default, as it even handles literals.
The old default can be selected by <tt>p -old</tt>. Since
FCFG does not support variable bindings, <tt>-old</tt> is automatically
selected if the grammar has bindings - and unless the <tt>-fcfg</tt> flag
is used.

<p>

17/6 (AR) The FCFG parser is now the recommended method for parsing
heavy grammars such as the resource grammars. It does not yet support
literals and variable bindings.

<p>

1/6 (AR) Added the FCFG parser written by Krasimir Angelov. Invoked by
<tt>p -fcfg</tt>. This parser is as general as MCFG but faster.
It needs more testing and debugging.

<p>

1/6 (AR) The command <tt>r = reload</tt> repeats the latest
<tt>i = import</tt> command.

<p>

30/5 (AR) It is now possible to use the flags <tt>-all, -table, -record</tt>
in combination with <tt>l -multi</tt>, and also with <tt>tb</tt>.

<p>

18/5 (AR) Introduced a wordlist format <tt>gfwl</tt> for
quick creation of language exercises and (in future) multilingual lexica.
The format is now very simple:
<pre>
  # Svenska - Franska - Finska
  berg      - montagne            - vuori
  klättra   - grimper / escalader - kiivetä / kiipeillä
</pre>
but can be extended to cover paradigm functions in addition to just
words.

<p>

3/4 (AR) The predefined abstract syntax type <tt>Int</tt> now has two
inherent parameters indicating its last digit and its size. The (hard-coded)
linearization type is
<pre>
  {s : Str ; size : Predef.Ints 1 ; last : Predef.Ints 9}
</pre>
The <tt>size</tt> field has value <tt>1</tt> for integers greater than 9, and
value <tt>0</tt> for other integers (which are never negative). This parameter can
be used e.g. in calculating number agreement,
<pre>
    Risala i = {s = i.s ++ table (Predef.Ints 1 * Predef.Ints 9) {
      &lt;0,1&gt;  =&gt; "risalah" ;
      &lt;0,2&gt;  =&gt; "risalatan" ;
      &lt;0,_&gt; | &lt;1,0&gt; =&gt; "rasail" ; 
      _ =&gt; "risalah"
      } ! &lt;i.size,i.last&gt;
    } ;
</pre>
Notice that the table has to be typed explicitly for <tt>Ints k</tt>, 
because type inference would otherwise return <tt>Int</tt> and therefore
fail to expand the table.


<p>

31/3 (AR) Added flags and options to some commands, to help generation:
<ul>
<li> <tt>gt -noexpand=NP,V,TV</tt> does not expand these categories,
but only generates metavariables for them.
<li> <tt>gt -doexpand=NP,V,TV</tt> only expands these categories,
and generates metavariables for others.
<li> <tt>gr -cf</tt> has the same flags.
<li> <tt>l -mark=metacat</tt> marks the metavariables with their categories.
<li> <tt>p -fail</tt> marks with <tt>#FAIL</tt> strings that have no parse.
<li> <tt>p -ambiguous</tt> marks as <tt>#AMBIGUOUS</tt>
     strings that have more than one parse.
</ul>

<p>

<hr>

21/3/2006 <b>Release of GF 2.5</b>.

<p>

16/3 (AR) Added two flag values to <tt>pt -transform=X</tt>:
<tt>nodup</tt> which excludes terms where a constant is duplicated,
and
<tt>nodupatom</tt> which excludes terms where an atomic constant is duplicated.
The latter, in particular, is useful as a filter in generation:
<pre>
  gt -cat=Cl | pt -transform=nodupatom
</pre>
This gives a corpus where words don't (usually) occur twice in the same clause.

<p>

6/3 (AR) Generalized the <tt>gfe</tt> file format in two ways:
<ol>
<li> Use the real grammar parser, hence <tt>(in M.C "foo")</tt> expressions
     may occur anywhere. But the <i>ad hoc</i> word substitution syntax is
     abandoned: ordinary <tt>let</tt> (and <tt>where</tt>) expressions
     can now be used instead.
<li> The resource may now be a treebank, not just a grammar. Parsing
     is thus replaced by treebank lookup, which in most cases is faster.
</ol>
A minor novelty is that the <tt>--# -resource=FILE</tt> flag can now be
relative to <tt>GF_LIB_PATH</tt>, both for grammars and treebanks.
The flag <tt> --# -treebank=IDENT</tt> gives the language whose treebank
entries are used, in case of a multilingual treebank.

<p>

4/3 (AR) Added command <tt>use_treebank = ut</tt> for lookup in a treebank.
This command can be used as a fast substitute for parsing, but also as a
way to browse treebanks.
<pre>
  ut "He adds this to that" | l -multi   -- use treebank lookup as parser in translation
  ut -assocs | grep "ComplV2"            -- show all associations with ComplV2
</pre>

<p>

3/3 (AR) Added option <tt>-treebank</tt> to the <tt>i</tt> command. This adds treebanks to
the shell state. The possible file formats are
<ol>
<li> XML file with a multilingual treebank, produced by <tt>tb -xml</tt>
<li> tab-organized text file with a unilingual treebank, produced by <tt>ut -assocs</tt>
</ol>
Notice that the treebanks in shell state are unilingual, and have strings as keys.
Multilingual treebanks have trees as keys. In case 1, one unilingual treebank per
language is built in the shell state.


<p>

1/3 (AR) Added option <tt>-trees</tt> to the command <tt>tree_bank = tb</tt>.
By this option, the command just returns the trees in the treebank. It can be
used for producing new treebanks with the same trees:
<pre>
  rf old.xml | tb -trees | tb -xml | wf new.xml
</pre>
Recall that only treebanks in the XML format can be read with the <tt>-trees</tt>
and <tt>-c</tt> flags.

<p>

1/3 (AR) A <tt>.gfe</tt> file can have a <tt>--# -path=PATH</tt> on its
second line. The file given on the first line (<tt>--# -resource=FILE</tt>) 
is then read w.r.t. this path. This is useful if the resource file has
no path itself, which happens when it is gfc-only.

<p>

25/2 (AR) The flag <tt>preproc</tt> of the <tt>i</tt> command (and thereby
to <tt>gf</tt> itself) causes GF to apply a preprocessor to each sourcefile
it reads.

<p>

8/2 (AR) The command <tt>tb = tree_bank</tt> for creating and testing against
multilingual treebanks. Example uses:
<pre>
  gr -cat=S -number=100 | tb -xml | wf tb.xml -- random treebank into file
  rf tb.txt | tb -c                           -- read comparison treebank from file
</pre>

<p>

10/1 (AR) Forbade variable binding inside negation and Kleene star
patterns. 

<p>

7/1 (AR) Full set of regular expression patterns, with
as-patterns to enable variable bindings to matched expressions:
<ul>
 <li> <i>p</i> <tt>+</tt> <i>q</i> : token consisting of <i>p</i> followed by <i>q</i>
 <li> <i>p</i> <tt>*</tt>          : token <i>p</i> repeated 0 or more times
                                     (max the length of the strin to be matched)
 <li> <tt>-</tt> <i>p</i>          : matches anything that <i>p</i> does not match
 <li> <i>x</i> <tt>@</tt> <i>p</i> : bind to <i>x</i> what <i>p</i> matches
 <li> <i>p</i> <tt>|</tt> <i>q</i> : matches what either <i>p</i> or <i>q</i> matches
</ul>
The last three apply to all types of patterns, the first two only to token strings.
Example: plural formation in Swedish 2nd declension
(<i>pojke-pojkar, nyckel-nycklar, seger-segrar, bil-bilar</i>):
<pre>
  plural2 : Str -> Str = \w -> case w of {
    pojk + "e"                       => pojk + "ar" ;
    nyck + "e" + l@("l" | "r" | "n") => nyck + l + "ar" ;
    bil                              => bil + "ar"
    } ;
</pre>
Semantics: variables are always bound to the <b>first match</b>, in the sequence defined
as the list <tt>Match p v</tt> as follows:
<pre>
  Match (p1|p2) v = Match p1 v ++ Match p2 v
  Match (p1+p2) s = [Match p1 s1 ++ Match p2 s2 | i <- [0..length s], (s1,s2) = splitAt i s]
  Match p*      s = Match "" s ++ Match p s ++ Match (p + p) s ++ ...
  Match c       v = [[]] if c == v  -- for constant patterns c
  Match x       v = [[(x,v)]]       -- for variable patterns x
  Match x@p     v = [[(x,v)]] + M   if M = Match p v /= []
  Match p       v = [] otherwise    -- failure
</pre>
Examples:
<ul>
<li> <tt>x + "e" + y</tt> matches <tt>"peter"</tt> with <tt>x = "p", y = "ter"</tt>
<li> <tt>x@("foo"*)</tt> matches any token with <tt>x = ""</tt>
<li> <tt>x + y@("er"*)</tt> matches <tt>"burgerer"</tt> with <tt>x = "burg", y = "erer"</tt>
</ul>
<p>

6/1 (AR) Concatenative string patterns to help morphology definitions...
This can be seen as a step towards regular expression string patterns. 
The natural notation <tt>p1 + p2</tt> will be considered later.
<b>Note</b>. This was done on 7/1.

<p>

5/1/2006 (BB) New grammar printers <tt>slf_sub</tt> and <tt>slf_sub_graphviz</tt>
for creating SLF networks with sub-automata.

<hr>

22/12 <b>Release of GF 2.4</b>.

<p>

21/12 (AR) It now works to parse escaped string literals from command
line, and also string literals with spaces:
<pre>
  gf examples/tram0/TramEng.gf
  > p -lexer=literals "I want to go to \"Gustaf Adolfs torg\" ;"
  QInput (GoTo (DestNamed "Gustaf Adolfs torg"))
</pre>

<p>

20/12 (AR) Support for full disjunctive patterns (<tt>P|Q</tt>) i.e.
not just on top level.

<p>

14/12 (BB) The command <tt>si</tt> (<tt>speech_input</tt>) which creates
a speech recognizer from a grammar for English and admits speech input
of strings has been added. The command uses an 
<a href="http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/develop/atk.shtml">ATK</a> recognizer and 
creates a recognition
network which accepts strings in the currently active grammar.
In order to use the <tt>si</tt> command, 
you need to install the 
<a href="http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~bringert/darcs/atkrec/">atkrec library</a>
and configure GF with <tt>./configure --with-atk</tt> before compiling. 
You need to set two environment variables for the <tt>si</tt> command to 
work. <tt>ATK_HOME</tt> should contain the path to your copy of ATK
and <tt>GF_ATK_CFG</tt> should contain the path to your GF ATK configuration
file. A default version of this file can be found in
 <tt>GF/src/gf_atk.cfg</tt>.


<p>

11/12 (AR) Parsing of float literals now possible in object language.
Use the flag <tt>lexer=literals</tt>.

<p>

6/12 (AR) Accept <tt>param</tt> and <tt>oper</tt> definitions in
<tt>concrete</tt> modules. The definitions are just inlined in the
current module and not inherited. The purpose is to support rapid
prototyping of grammars.

<p>

2/12 (AR) The built-in type <tt>Float</tt> added to abstract syntax (and
resource). Values are stored as Haskell's <tt>Double</tt> precision
floats. For the syntax of float literals, see BNFC document.
NB: some bug still prevents parsing float literals in object
languages. <b>Bug fixed 11/12.</b>

<p>

1/12 (BB,AR) The command <tt>at = apply_transfer</tt>, which applies
a transfer function to a term. This is used for noncompositional
translation. Transfer functions are defined in a special transfer
language (file suffix <tt>.tr</tt>), which is compiled into a
run-time transfer core language (file suffix <tt>.trc</tt>).
The compiler is included in <tt>GF/transfer</tt>. The following is
a complete example of how to try out transfer:
<pre>
  % cd GF/transfer
  % make                            -- compile the trc compiler
  % cd examples                     -- GF/transfer/examples
  % ../compile_to_core -i../lib numerals.tr
  % mv numerals.trc ../../examples/numerals
  % cd ../../examples/numerals      -- GF/examples/numerals
  % gf
     > i decimal.gf
     > i BinaryDigits.gf
     > i numerals.trc
     > p -lang=Cncdecimal "123" | at num2bin | l
     1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0
</pre>
Other relevant commands are:
<ul>
<li> <tt>i file.trc</tt>: import a transfer module
<li> <tt>pg -printer=transfer</tt>: create a syntax datatype in <tt>.tr</tt> format 
</ul>
For more information on the commands, see <tt>help</tt>. Documentation on
the transfer language: to appear. 

<p>

17/11 (AR) Made it possible for lexers to be nondeterministic.
Now with a simple-minded implementation that the parser is sent
each lexing result in turn. The option <tt>-cut</tt> is used for
breaking after first lexing leading to successful parse. The only
nondeterministic lexer right now is <tt>-lexer=subseqs</tt>, which
first filters with <tt>-lexer=ignore</tt> (dropping words neither in
the grammar nor literals) and then starts ignoring other words from
longest to shortest subsequence. This is usable for parser tasks
of keyword spotting type, but expensive (2<sup>n</sup>) in long input.
A smarter implementation is therefore desirable.

<p>

14/11 (AR) Functions can be made unparsable (or "internal" as
in BNFC). This is done by <tt>i -noparse=file</tt>, where
the nonparsable functions are given in <tt>file</tt> using the
line format <tt>--# noparse Funs</tt>. This can be used e.g. to
rule out expensive parsing rules. It is used in 
<tt>lib/resource/abstract/LangVP.gf</tt> to get parse values 
structured with <tt>VP</tt>, which is obtained via transfer.
So far only the default (= old) parser generator supports this.

<p>

14/11 (AR) Removed the restrictions how a lincat may look like.
Now any record type that has a value in GFC (i.e. without any
functions in it) can be used, e.g. {np : NP ; cn : Bool => CN}.
To display linearization values, only <tt>l -record</tt> shows
nice results.

<p>

9/11 (AR) GF shell state can now have several abstract syntaxes with
their associated concrete syntaxes. This allows e.g. parsing with
resource while testing an application. One can also have a
parse-transfer-lin chain from one abstract syntax to another.

<p>
7/11 (BB) Running commands can now be interrupted with Ctrl-C, without
killing the GF process. This feature is not supported on Windows.

<p>

1/11 (AR) Yet another method for adding probabilities: append
<tt> --# prob Double</tt> to the end of a line defining a function.
This can be (1) a <tt>.cf</tt> rule (2) a <tt>fun</tt> rule, or
(3) a <tt>lin</tt> rule. The probability is attached to the
first identifier on the line.

<p>
1/11 (BB) Added generation of weighted SRGS grammars. The weights
are calculated from the function probabilities. The algorithm
for calculating the weights is not yet very good.
Use <tt>pg -printer=srgs_xml_prob</tt>.

<p>
31/10 (BB) Added option for converting grammars to SRGS grammars in XML format.
Use <tt>pg -printer=srgs_xml</tt>.

<p>

31/10 (AR) Probabilistic grammars. Probabilities can be used to
weight random generation (<tt>gr -prob</tt>) and to rank parse
results (<tt>p -prob</tt>). They are read from a separate file
(flag <tt>i -probs=File</tt>, format <tt>--# prob Fun Double</tt>)
or from the top-level grammar file itself (option <tt>i -prob</tt>).
To see the probabilities, use <tt>pg -printer=probs</tt>.
<br>
As a by-product, the probabilistic random generation algorithm is
available for any context-free abstract syntax. Use the flag
<tt>gr -cf</tt>. This algorithm is much faster than the
old (more general) one, but it may sometimes loop.

<p>

12/10 (AR) Flag <tt>-atoms=Int</tt> to the command <tt>gt = generate_trees</tt>
takes away all zero-argument functions except Int per category. In
this way, it is possible to generate a corpus illustrating each
syntactic structure even when the lexicon (which consists of
zero-argument functions) is large.

<p>

6/10 (AR) New commands <tt>dc = define_command</tt> and
<tt>dt = define_tree</tt> to define macros in a GF session.
See <tt>help</tt> for details and examples. 

<p>

5/10 (AR) Printing missing linearization rules:
<tt>pm -printer=missing</tt>. Command <tt>g = grep</tt>,
which works in a way similar to Unix grep.

<p>

5/10 (PL) Printing graphs with function and category dependencies:
<tt>pg -printer=functiongraph</tt>, <tt>pg -printer=typegraph</tt>.

<p>

20/9 (AR) Added optimization by <b>common subexpression elimination</b>.
It works on GFC modules and creates <tt>oper</tt> definitions for
subterms that occur more than once in <tt>lin</tt> definitions. These
<tt>oper</tt> definitions are automatically reinlined in functionalities
that don't support <tt>oper</tt>s in GFC. This conversion is done by
module and the <tt>oper</tt>s are not inherited. Moreover, the subterms
can contain free variables which means that the <tt>oper</tt>s are not
always well typed. However, since all variables in GFC are type-specific
(and local variables are <tt>lin</tt>-specific), this does not destroy
subject reduction or cause illegal captures. 
<br>
The optimization is triggered by the flag <tt>optimize=OPT_subs</tt>,
where <tt>OPT</tt> is any of the other optimizations (see <tt>h -optimize</tt>).
The most aggressive value of the flag is <tt>all_subs</tt>. In experiments,
the size of a GFC module can shrink by 85% compared to plain <tt>all</tt>.

<p>

18/9 (AR) Removed superfluous spaces from GFC printing. This shrinks
the GFC size by 5-10%.

<p>

15/9 (AR) Fixed some bugs in dependent-type type checking of abstract
modules at compile time. The type checker is more severe now, which means
that some old grammars may fail to compile - but this is usually the
right result. However, the type checker of <tt>def</tt> judgements still
needs work.

<p>

14/9 (AR) Added printing of grammars to a format without parameters, in
the spirit of Peanos "Latino sine flexione". The command <tt>pg -unpar</tt>
does the trick, and the result can be saved in a <tt>gfcm</tt> file. The generated
concrete syntax modules get the prefix <tt>UP_</tt>. The translation is briefly:
<pre>
  (P => T)*               =  T*
  (t ! p)*                =  t*
  (table {p => t ; ...})* =  t*
</pre>
In order for this to be maximally useful, the grammar should be written in such
a way that the first value of every parameter type is the desired one. For
instance, in Peano's case it would be the ablative for noun cases, the singular for
numbers, and the 2nd person singular imperative for verb forms.

<p>

14/9 (BB) Added finite state approximation of grammars. 
Internally the conversion is done <tt>cfg -&gt; regular -&gt; fa -&gt; slf</tt>, so the
different printers can be used to check the output of each stage.
The new options are:
<dl>
<dt><tt>pg -printer=slf</tt></dt>
<dd>A finite automaton in the HTK SLF format.</dd>
<dt><tt>pg -printer=slf_graphviz</tt></dt>
<dd>The same FA as in SLF, but in Graphviz format.</dd>
<dt><tt>pg -printer=fa_graphviz</tt></dt>
<dd>A finite automaton with labelled edges, instead of labelled nodes which SLF has.</dd>
<dt><tt>pg -printer=regular</tt></dt>
<dd>A regular grammar in a simple BNF.</dd>
</dl>

<p>

4/9 (AR) Added the option <tt>pg -printer=stat</tt> to show
statistics of gfc compilation result. To be extended with new information.
The most important stats now are the top-40 sized definitions.

<p>
<hr>

1/7 <b>Release of GF 2.3</b>.

<p>


1/7 (AR) Added the flag <tt>-o</tt> to the <tt>vt</tt> command
to just write the <tt>.dot</tt> file without going to <tt>.ps</tt>
(cf. 20/6).

<p>

29/6 (AR) The printer used by Embedded Java GF Interpreter 
(<tt>pm -header</tt>) now produces
working code from all optimized grammars - hence you need not select a 
weaker optimization just to use the interpreter. However, the
optimization <tt>-optimize=share</tt> usually produces smaller object
grammars because the "unoptimizer" just undoes all optimizations.
(This is to be considered a temporary solution until the interpreter
knows how to handle stronger optimizations.)

<p>

27/6 (AR) The flag <tt>flags optimize=noexpand</tt> placed in a
resource module prevents the optimization phase of the compiler when
the <tt>.gfr</tt> file is created. This can prevent serious code
explosion, but it will also make the processing of modules using the
resource slowwer. A favourable example is <tt>lib/resource/finnish/ParadigmsFin</tt>.

<p>

23/6 (HD,AR) The new editor GUI <tt>gfeditor</tt> by Hans-Joachim
Daniels can now be used. It is based on Janna Khegai's <tt>jgf</tt>.
New functionality include HTML display (<tt>gfeditor -h</tt>) and
programmable refinement tooltips.

<p>

23/6 (AR) The flag <tt>unlexer=finnish</tt> can be used to bind
Finnish suffixes (e.g. possessives) to preceding words. The GF source
notation is e.g. <tt>"isä" ++ "&*" ++ "nsa" ++ "&*" ++ "ko"</tt>,
which unlexes to <tt>"isänsäkö"</tt>. There is no corresponding lexer
support yet.


<p>

22/6 (PL,AR) The MCFG parser (<tt>p -mcfg</tt>) now works on all
optimized grammars - hence you need not select a weaker optimization
to use this parser. The same concerns the CFGM printer (<tt>pm -printer=cfgm</tt>).

<p>

20/6 (AR) Added the command <tt>visualize_tree</tt> = <tt>vt</tt>, to
display syntax trees graphically. Like <tt>vg</tt>, this command uses
GraphViz and Ghostview. The foremost use is to pipe the parser to this
command.

<p>

17/6 (BB) There is now support for lists in GF abstract syntax.
A list category is declared as:
<pre>
cat [C]
</pre>
or
<pre>
cat [C]{n}
</pre>
where <tt>C</tt> is a category and <tt>n</tt> is a non-negative integer.
<tt>cat [C]</tt> is equivalent to <tt>cat [C]{0}</tt>. List category
syntax can be used whereever categories are used.

<p>

<tt>cat [C]{n}</tt> is equivalent to the declarations:
<pre>
cat ListC
fun BaseC : C^n -&gt; ListC
fun ConsC : C -&gt; ListC -&gt; ListC
</pre>

where <tt>C^0 -&gt; X</tt> means <tt>X</tt>, and <tt>C^m</tt> (where
m &gt; 0) means <tt>C -&gt; C^(m-1)</tt>.

<p>

A lincat declaration on the form:
<pre>
lincat [C] = T
</pre>
is equivalent to
<pre>
lincat ListC = T
</pre>

The linearizations of the list constructors are written
just like they would be if the function declarations above
had been made manually, e.g.:
<pre>
lin BaseC x_1 ... x_n = t
lin ConsC x xs = t'
</pre>

<p>

10/6 (AR) Preprocessor of <tt>.gfe</tt> files can now be performed as part of
any grammar compilation. The flag <tt>-ex</tt> causes GF to look for
the <tt>.gfe</tt> files and preprocess those that are younger
than the corresponding <tt>.gf</tt> files. The files are first sorted
and grouped by the resource, so that each resource only need be compiled once.

<p>

10/6 (AR) Editor GUI can now be alternatively invoked by the shell
command <tt>gf -edit</tt> (equivalent to <tt>jgf</tt>).

<p>

10/6 (AR) Editor GUI command <tt>pc Int</tt> to pop <tt>Int</tt>
items from the clip board.

<p>

4/6 (AR) Sequence of commands in the Java editor GUI now possible.
The commands are separated by <tt> ;; </tt> (notice the space on
both sides of the two semicolons). Such a sequence can be sent
from the "GF Command"  pop-up field, but is mostly intended
for external processes that communicate with GF.

<p>

3/6 (AR) The format <tt>.gfe</tt> defined to support
<b>grammar writing by examples</b>. Files of this format are first
converted to <tt>.gf</tt> files by the command
<pre>
  gf -examples File.gfe
</pre>
See <a href="../lib/resource/doc/example/QuestionsI.gfe">
<tt>../lib/resource/doc/examples/QuestionsI.gfe</tt></a>
for an example.

<p>

31/5 (AR) Default of p -rawtrees=k changed to 999999.

<p>

31/5 (AR) Support for restricted inheritance. Syntax:
<pre>
  M          -- inherit everything from M, as before
  M [a,b,c]  -- only inherit constants a,b,c
  M-[a,b,c]  -- inherit everything except a,b,c
</pre>
Caution: there is no check yet for completeness and
consistency, but restricted inheritance can create
run-time failures.

<p>

29/5 (AR) Parser support for reading GFC files line per line.
The category <tt>Line</tt> in <tt>GFC.cf</tt> can be used
as entrypoint instead of <tt>Grammar</tt> to achieve this.

<p>

28/5 (AR) Environment variables and path wild cards.
<ul>
<li> <tt>GF_LIB_PATH</tt> gives the location of <tt>GF/lib</tt>
<li> <tt>GF_GRAMMAR_PATH</tt> gives a list of directories appended
     to the explicitly given path
<li> <tt>DIR/*</tt> is expanded to the union of all subdirectories
     of <tt>DIR</tt>
</ul>
<p>


26/5/2005 (BB) Notation for list categories.
