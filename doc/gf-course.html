<P>
The structure of each lecture will be the following:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>ca. 70min lecture, going through the book
<LI>ca. 20min work on computer, individually or in pairs
</UL>

<P>
In order for this to work out, it is important that enough many
have a working GF installation, including the directory
<A HREF="../examples/tutorial"><CODE>examples/tutorial</CODE></A>. This directory is
included in the Darcs version, as well as in the updated binary
packages from 12 September.
</P>
<H1>Purpose</H1>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~aarne/GF/">GF</A>
(Grammatical Framework) is a grammar formalism, i.e. a special-purpose
programming language for writing grammars. It is suitable for many
natural language processing tasks, in particular,
</P>
<UL>
<LI>multilingual applications
<LI>systems where grammar-based components are needed for e.g.
  parsing, translation, or speech recognition
</UL>

<P>
The goal of the course is to develop an understanding of GF and 
practical skills in using it.
</P>
<H1>Contents</H1>
<P>
The course consists of two modules. The first module is a one-week
intensive course (during the first intensive week of GSLT), which
is as such usable as a one-week intensive course for doctoral studies,
if completed with a small course project.
</P>
<P>
The second module is a larger programming project, written
by each student (possibly working in groups) during the Autumn term.
The projects are discussed during the second intensive week of GSLT
(see <A HREF="http://www.gslt.hum.gu.se/courses/schedule.html">schedule</A>),
and presented at a date that will be set later.
</P>
<P>
The first module goes through the basics of GF, including
</P>
<UL>
<LI>using the GF programming language
<LI>writing multilingual grammars
<LI>using the 
  <A HREF="http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~aarne/GF/lib/resource-1.0/doc/">GF resource grammar library</A>
<LI>generating speech recognition systems from GF grammars
<LI>using embedded grammars as components of software systems
</UL>

<P>
The lectures follow a draft of GF book. It contains a heavily updated
version os the
<A HREF="http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~aarne/GF/doc/tutorial/gf-tutorial2.html">GF Tutorial</A>;
thus the on-line tutorial is not adequate for this course. To get the course
book, join the course mailing list.
</P>
<P>
Those who just want to do the first module will write a simple application
as their course work during and after the first intensive week.
</P>
<P>
Those who continue with the second module will choose a more substantial
project. Possible topics are
</P>
<UL>
<LI>building a dialogue system by using GF
<LI>implementing a multilingual document generator 
<LI>experimenting with synthetized multilingual tree banks
<LI>extending the GF resource grammar library
</UL>

<H1>Prerequisites</H1>
<P>
Experience in programming. No earlier natural language processing
or functional programming experience is necessary.
</P>
<P>
The course is thus suitable both for GSLT and NGSLT students,
and for graduate students in computer science.
</P>
<P>
We will in particular welcome students from the Baltic countries
who wish to build resources for their own language in GF.
