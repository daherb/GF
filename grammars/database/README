Project starting to redo the old-gf database query grammars, this time 
using resource grammars.

The base grammars DatabaseX are built as instantiations of the
parametrized module DatabaseI. They are therefore easy to add
for any language supporting the resource interface Resource,
following the model of DatabaseEng and DatabaseSwe.

The restaurant vocabulary is so far only available for
English and Swedish. The rest should be easy to modify from
corresponging grammars in the GF 1 grammar package. This time,
however, only the ParadigmsX modules should be used to define the
lexical entries.
