The naming of the grammars tut1.*.gf comes from their use in the
first GF tutorial in 1998. They still make a good starting
point to try out translating and editing. Their code is mostly 
automatic translation from old-GF source.

The grammars Basic.gf and English.gf follow the module syntax
of GF 2. The other grammars can also be used in GF 2, which
creates a module structure when compiling them.
