The French resource API implementation, based on romance.

The Verbes* modules were translated from an XML resource created 
by Sylvain Pogodalla.

WARNING: The subcategorization information is not very reliable
(the extraction method is the main thing to blame).

The biggest test grammar is TestVerbesFre.

We recommend using GF with extra stack and heap:

  gf +RTS -K10M -H200M

We recommend reading grammars from source and not emitting gfc code,
since, the size of gfc files becomes enormous. Thus:

  i -noemit -src -cflexer TestVerbesFre.gf

So it seems we'll have to work on effectivizing GF!

Useful tests:

  l -table choirVN                             -- create infl table

  ma "cours cherra"                            -- analyse a couple of forms

  gr -cat=Cl | l -table                        -- generate random sentence

  gr PredVG HeNP (PredV2 (UseVN2 ?) SheNP) | l -table -- idem, of form "il la X"

  rf labible.txt | ma | wf labible.tagged             -- tag the bible (first get it!)

  mq -cat=VN2                                         -- run a morphology quiz
