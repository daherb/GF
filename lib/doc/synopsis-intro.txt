This document contains the most important parts of the GF Resource Grammar API.
It has been machine-generated from the source files; each chapter gives a link
to the relevant source files, which give more information. Some of the files have
not yet been prepared so that the machine generated documentation has the nicest
possible format.

The current status of resource grammar completion for different languages is shown
in [``status.html`` ./status.html].

The [first chapter #toc2] shows the categories, with links to the functions for
constructing trees in them.

The [second chapter #toc5] shows the construction functions, with cross-links and
examples. Most examples can be seen in multiple languages by hovering the
mouse over the example, as shown in the following screenshot:

The [third chapter #toc83] shows morphological paradigms.

The [fourth chapter #toc100] gives instructions on how to "browse" the library by 
loading the grammars into the ``gf`` command editor.

The [last chapter #toc101] contains a brief example of how application grammars can
import resource modules. At the same time, it illustrates a "design pattern" for 
using the resource API to build functor-based applications

The [table of contents #toc102] is at the end of the file.
