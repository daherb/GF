A Guided Tour of Swedish Grammar
Aarne Ranta



This is an introduction to the basic grammar of Swedish. 
It is guided by a computer program that knows the rules of the grammar.
The program has produced the examples shown during the tour.
You can read this document without access to the program, and get an
overview of Swedish grammar rules. 
However, really to make use of the knowledge included in the program,
you should try out every rule by itself and also vary the rules in
interaction with the computer. 

You can make the same tour, with appropriate modifications, with
Bulgarian 
Catalan
Dutch
Finnish
French
German


=Computer prerequisites=

To use the Swedish grammar program and test the grammar yourself, you need
- a computer with Linux, Mac OS, or Windows
- the program GF (Grammatical Framework), downloadable from
  the [GF website http://grammaticalframework.org]
- the grammar package ``Lang.pgf``, downloadable from [here ./Lang.pgf]


In future, we plan to provide a web-based version of this grammar tour,
so that you can ran the program without downloading or installing anything.

After installing GF (see instructions at GF website), just start it by
the shell command
```
  gf Lang.pgf
```
Then initialize the shell with a couple of handy commands:

| ``%translate`` | translate an utterance from English to Swedish |
| ``%table``     | show the inflection table a word or a phrase in Swedish
| ``%forms``     | show the forms of a word or a phrase in Swedish

Initialization is made with the following commands, which define command macros in GF:
```
> dc translate ps -lextext ?0 | parse -cat=Utt -lang=LangEng | linearize -lang=LangSwe
> dc table linearize -table -lang=LangSwe ?0
> dc forms linearize -list -lang=LangSwe ?0
> dc numeral ps -chars "123" | p -cat=Digits -lang=LangSwe | pt -transfer=digits2num | l -lang=LangSwe
```
This is just to save you some work afterwards and to make this document
clearer; you could quite as well use the basic commands that are predifined
in GF, and for some less frequent cases we'll actually use them directly.

The **prompt** sign ``>`` is produced by GF, and you should only
write what is after it. In this document, we will use two kinds of markings
of type-written lines:
- ``>`` followed by a command you type
- ``*`` followed by output from GF


=Words and inflection=

We are ready to start the tour. We begin in the same way as grammar books usually do:
from words and their forms.


==Nouns==

Nouns in Swedish have 8 #Swe
inflection forms, as shown by the following example:
```
> %table flower_N
* s Sg Indef Nom : blomma
* s Sg Indef Gen : blommas
* s Sg Def Nom : blomman
* s Sg Def Gen : blommans
* s Pl Indef Nom : blommor
* s Pl Indef Gen : blommors
* s Pl Def Nom : blommorna
* s Pl Def Gen : blommornas
```
Here are the main noun inflection patterns - the
declensions 1 to 5: #SWE
```
> %forms flower_N
* blomma, blommas, blomman, blommans, blommor, blommors, blommorna, blommornas

> %forms car_N
* bil, bils, bilen, bilens, bilar, bilars, bilarna, bilarnas

> %forms cat_N
* katt, katts, katten, kattens, katter, katters, katterna, katternas

> %forms apple_N
* äpple, äpples, äpplet, äpplets, äpplen, äpplens, äpplena, äpplenas

> %forms house_N
* hus, hus, huset, husets, hus, hus, husen, husens
```
The symbol ``N`` is used by GF to denote nouns. Here it is suffixed to
English words meaning the same as the Swedish forms.

Swedish nouns also have a gender, which is reflected, among
other things, in the indefinite article they have:
```
> %translate "a man"
* en man

> %translate "a woman"
* en kvinna

> %translate "a house"
* ett hus
```
The little lexicon of the grammar training program has 182 nouns. To see 
them all, together with their inflection forms and English translations, 
you can do
```
> generate_trees -cat=N | linearize -treebank -list -lang=LangSwe

* airplane_N
* flygplan, flygplans, flygplanet, flygplanets, flygplan, flygplans, flygplanen, flygplanens

* animal_N
* djur, djurs, djuret, djurets, djur, djurs, djuren, djurens
```

===Quizzes with nouns===

You can try out a **morphology quiz**, which lets you train your knowledge
of Swedish noun inflection. You can later train your inflection skills with
other parts of speech, just changing the symbol ``N`` to some other symbol.
```
> morpho_quiz -cat=N -lang=LangSwe

* Welcome to GF Morphology Quiz.
* The quiz is over when you have done at least 10 examples
* with at least 75 % success.
* You can interrupt the quiz by entering a line consisting of a dot ('.').
* 
* vin s Pl Def Gen
* vinernas
* > Yes.
* Score 1/1
* tunga s Sg Indef Nom
* tungan
* > No, not tungan, but
* tunga
* Score 1/2
```
The quiz questions are randomly generated, so you can use the same
quiz for increasing your Swedish skills over and over again.

Another quiz is the **translation quiz**, which lets you to train translations
of nouns from English to Swedish (or, in fact, of any part of speech from any
language to any other one). Here is how it goes:
```
> tq -from=LangEng -to=LangSwe -cat=N
* Welcome to GF Translation Quiz.
* The quiz is over when you have done at least 10 examples
* with at least 75 % success.
* You can interrupt the quiz by entering a line consisting of a dot ('.').
*
* ceiling
* tak
* > Yes.
* Score 1/1
* night
* nat
* > No, not nat, but
* natt
```


==Numerals and determiners==

Numerals are in Swedish the easiest way to build complex noun phrases from nouns,
since their forms are independent of the noun; the noun is just inflected in
the plural indefinite. This is with the exception of "one", whose form depends
on the gender of the noun. Here is a quick way to generate the numerals from 1 to 9:
```
> gt -cat=Sub10 -number=9 | l
> gt -cat=Sub10 -number=9 | l -lang=LangSwe
* en
* två
* tre
* fyra
* fem
* sex
* sju
* åtta
* nio
```
Translate digits to Swedish numerals:
```
> %numeral "123"
* ett hundra tjugo tre
```
Translate noun phrases with numerals and nouns:
```
> %translate "one boy"
* en pojke

> %translate "one apple"
* ett äpple

> %translate "two boys"
* två pojkar

> %translate "eleven cars"
* elva bilar
```
Numerals are a special case of **determiners**: words that are combined with nouns to
form **noun phrases**. Articles are anouther special case; we already saw the indefinite
articles:
```
> %translate "a man, a woman, a car and a house"
* en man , en kvinna , en bil och ett hus
```
Definite articles are more special in Swedish: 
they are expressed by inflecting the noun rather than adding a word like
English //the//. #SWE
```
> %translate "the man, the woman, the car and the house"
* mannen , kvinnan , bilen och huset
```
This is similar in the plural:
```
> %translate "the men, the women, the cars and the houses"
* männen , kvinnorna , bilarna och husen
```
Just like in English, there is no explicit indefinite article in the plural: 
just use the plural indefinite form. #SWE
```
> %translate "men, women, cars and houses"
* män , kvinnor , bilar och hus
```
Other common determiners are shown in the following:
```
> %translate "this car, that car, these cars, those cars, some cars and all cars"
* den här bilen , den där bilen , de här bilarna , de där bilarna , några bilar och alla bilar

```
Generate more examples of nouns with determiners:
```
> gr -number=11 (DetCN ? (UseN ?)) | l
* much reason
* mycket anledning
* 
* few grammars
* få grammatiker
* 
* some teacher
* någon lärare
```
You will find out that other determiners can combine with numerals, such as in
```
> %translate "these seven sisters"
* de här sju systrarna
```
In these cases, the definite article suddenly appears as a word: #SWE
```
> %translate "the seven sisters"
* de sju systrarna
```
