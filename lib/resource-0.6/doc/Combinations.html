<h1> Abstract Syntax for Multilingual Resource Grammar</h1>

<p>
Aarne Ranta 2002 -- 2003
<p>
Although concrete syntax differs a lot between different languages,
many structures can be treated as common, on the level
of abstraction that GF provides. 
What we will present in the following is a linguistically oriented abstract 
syntax that has been successfully defined for the following languages:
<p>
<li><tt>Eng</tt>lish
<li><tt>Fin</tt>nish
<li><tt>Fre</tt>nch
<li><tt>Ger</tt>man
<li><tt>Ita</tt>lian
<li><tt>Rus</tt>sian
<li><tt>Swe</tt>dish
<p>
The three-letter prefixes are used in file names all over the resource
grammar library; we refer to them commonly as <tt>X</tt> below.
<p>
<!-- NEW -->
The grammar has been applied to define language
fragments on technical or near-to-technical domains: database queries,
video recorder dialogue systems, software specifications, and a 
health-related phrase book. Each new application helped to identify some
missing structures in the resource and suggested some additions, but the
number of required additions was usually small.

To use the resource in applications, you need the following 
<tt>cat</tt> and <tt>fun</tt> rules in <tt>oper</tt> form, completed by taking the
<tt>lincat</tt> and <tt>lin</tt> judgements of a particular language. This is done
by using, instead of this module, the <tt>reuse</tt> module which has the name
<tt>ResourceX</tt>. It is located in the subdirectory
<tt>grammars/resource/lang</tt> where <tt>lang</tt> is the full name of the language.

<h2> Categories</h2>
<p>
The categories of this resource grammar are mostly 'standard' categories
of linguistics. Their is no claim that they correspond to semantic categories
definable in type theory: to define such correspondences is the business
of applications grammars. In general, the correspondence between linguistic
and semantic categories is many-to-many.
<p>
Categories that may look special are <tt>Adj2</tt>, <tt>Fun</tt>, and <tt>TV</tt>. They are all
instances of endowing another category with a complement, which can be either
a direct object (whose case may vary) or a prepositional phrase. Prepositional
phrases that are not complements belong to the category
<tt>AdV</tt> of adverbials.
<p>
In each group below, some categories are <b>lexical</b> in the sense of only
containing atomic elements. These elements are not necessarily expressed by
one word in all languages; the essential thing is that they have no
constituents. Thus they have no productions in this part of the 
resource grammar. The <tt>ParadigmsX</tt> grammars provide ways of defining
lexical elements.
<p>
Lexical categories are listed before other categories
in each group and divided by an empty line.

<h2> Rules</h2>
<p>
This set of rules is minimal, in the sense of defining the simplest combinations
of categories and not having redundant rules.
When the resource grammar is used as a library, it will often be useful to
access it through an intermediate library that defines more rules as 
'macros' for combinations of the ones below.

<h3> Verbs and verb phrases</h3>
<p>
The principal way of forming sentences (<tt>S</tt>) is by combining a noun phrase
with a verb phrase (the <tt>PredVP</tt> rule below). In addition to this, verb
phrases have uses in relative clauses and questions. Verb phrases already
have (or have not) a negation, but they are formed from verbal groups
(<tt>VG</tt>), which have both positive and negative forms.
<pre>
    PredV       : V  -> VG ;             -- "walk", "doesn't walk"
    PredPassV   : V  -> VG ;             -- "is seen", "is not seen"
    PredTV      : TV -> NP -> VG ;       -- "sees John", "doesn't see John"
    PredVS      : VS -> S  -> VG ;       -- "says that I run", "doesn't say..."
    PredVV      : VV -> VG -> VG ;       -- "can run", "can't run", "tries to run"
    PredV3      : V3 -> NP -> NP -> VG ; -- "prefers wine to beer"

<h3> Coordination</h3>
<p>
We consider <i>n</i>-ary coordination, with <i>n</i> > 1. To this end, we have introduced
a <b>list category</b> <tt>ListX</tt> for each category <tt>X</tt> whose expressions we want to
conjoin. Each list category has two constructors, the base case being <tt>TwoX</tt>.
We have not defined coordination of all possible categories here,
since it can be tricky in many languages. For instance, <tt>VP</tt> coordination
is linguistically problematic in German because <tt>VP</tt> is a discontinuous
category.
<pre>
    ConjS  : Conj -> ListS -> S ;            -- "John walks and Mary runs"
    ConjAP : Conj -> ListAP -> AP ;          -- "even and prime"
    ConjNP : Conj -> ListNP -> NP ;          -- "John or Mary"
  
    ConjDS  : ConjD -> ListS -> S ;          -- "either John walks or Mary runs"
    ConjDAP : ConjD -> ListAP -> AP ;        -- "both even and prime"
    ConjDNP : ConjD -> ListNP -> NP ;        -- "either John or Mary"

<h3> Subordination</h3>

Subjunctions are different from conjunctions, but form
a uniform category among themselves.

    SubjImper : Subj -> S -> Imp -> Imp ;    -- "if it is hot, use a glove!"
