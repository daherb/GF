Renaming on Mac:

  for each in *Eng.gf ;  
  do 
  mv $each $(basename $each Eng.gf)Lat.gf
  done

In-place change:

  sed -e 's/Eng/Lat/g' -i *Lat.gf

Start with the following:

Trying to get a gold standard for the lexicon

Step 1: Start finishing the lexicon using Langenscheidts Schulwoerterbuch Latein
and the Latin Wikipedia
Some Problems:
- no excat translation for ceiling
- same word for child and boy/girl
- different words for find either by accident or after searching
- no exact translation for glove
- no exact translation for hat and cap
- no translation for married in Langescheidt,
- no exact translation for pen in Langenscheidt, assume similarity to stylus
- is planet really masculine?
- same word for boot and shoe?
- make/extinguish fire as words for switch on/off
- same word for bone and leg
- i hate ambigous words
Todo:
- Need to check prepositions

Step 2: Define linearization for the first categories and generate the paradigms
- Change CatLat.gf a little bit
- Comment all lexicon entries with categories without linearization or generating
  errors in ResLat.gf
- Create gf script generate_paradigms.gfs to generate all yet implemented word forms

Step 3: Check the forms in paradigms.txt

Lots and lots of work. Starting to use incremented checking and changing

Changing morphology:
splitting 3rd declension into consonant and i-declension
defining rules for each of this classes
