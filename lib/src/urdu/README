Urdu resource grammar in GF

Sources: files in ./transliterated/ convert to files with the same names in ./
**Don't hand-edit** the generated files, but the ones in ./transliterated/
To convert the edited files, do 'make' in this directory.

Principles: all files containing string literals are in ./transliterated/
**Don't put string literals** in other files. Add string opers to transliterated/ResUrd.gf 
instead (to the end of the file).

Purpose: the files without strings will work as such for Hindi as well.
