Parsing overloaded resource constructors.

AR 2/7/2007.

Do this way in gf:

  > i OverLangEng.gf

  > p -overload -cat=S "I loved her"

  mkS pastTense (mkCl (mkNP i_Pron) love_V2 (mkNP she_Pron))

The program FromOverload.hs creates the files OverGrammar.gf and OverGrammarEng.gf
from constr.gf (which in turn is the latter part of ../Constructors.gf).


Some imperative and punctuation forms are still missing, since they are treated
with special parameters.
