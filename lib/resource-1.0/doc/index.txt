**Notice**. This document concerns the API v. 1.0 which has not
yet been "officially" released. You can find the beginnings of it
in [``GF/lib/resource-1.0/`` ..]. See
[``resource-1.0/README`` ../README] for
details on how it differs from previous versions
and how much has been implemented



==Using the library==

There is no need to link application grammars to the source directories of the
library. Use one (or several) of the following packages instead:

- ``lib/alltenses`` the complete ground-API library with all forms
- ``lib/present`` a pruned ground-API library with present tense only
- ``lib/mathematical`` special-purpose API for mathematical applications
- ``lib/multimodal`` special-purpose API for multimodal dialogue applications


Notice, however, that both special-purpose APIs share modules with
``present``. It is therefore not a good idea to use them in combination with
``alltenses``.


It is advisable to use the bare package names in paths pointing to the
libraries. Here is an example, from ``examples/tram``:
```
  --# -path=.:present:multimodal:mathematical:prelude
```
To reach these directories from anywhere, set the environment variable
``GF_LIB_PATH`` to point to the directory ``GF/lib/``. For instance,
I have the following line in my ``.bashrc`` file:
```
  export GF_LIB_PATH=/home/aarne/GF/lib
```



==The language independent API==

This API is accessible by both ``present`` and ``alltenses``.
The API is divided into a bunch of ``abstract`` modules.
The following figure gives the dependencies of these modules.
