This document contains the most important parts of the GF Resource Grammar API.
It has been machine-generated from the source files; each chapter gives a link
to the relevant source files, which give more information.

The last chapter contains a brief example of how application grammars can
import resource modules. It also illustrates a "design pattern" for using
the resource API to build functor-based applications
