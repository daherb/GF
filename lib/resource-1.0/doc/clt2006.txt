#NEW

==Purpose==

===Library for applications===

High-level access to grammatical rules

E.g. //You have k new messages// rendered in ten languages //X//
```
  render X (Have (You (Number (k (New Message)))))
```

Usability for different purposes
- translation systems
- software localization
- dialogue systems
- language teaching


#NEW

===Grammar as parser===

Often in NLP, a grammar is just high-level code for a parser.

But writing a grammar can be inadequate for parsing:
- too much manual work
- too inefficient
- not robust
- too ambiguous


Moreover, a grammar fine-tuned for parsing may not be reusable
- for generation
- for specialized grammars
- as library


#NEW

===Grammar as language definition===

Linguistic ontology: **abstract syntax**

E.g. adjectival modification
```
  AdjCN : AP -> CN -> CN ;
```

Rendering in different languages: **concrete syntax**

Resource grammars have generation perspective, rather than parsing
- abstract syntax serves as a key to expressions in different languages



#NEW

===Usability by non-linguists===

Division of labour: resource grammars hide linguistic details
- ``AdjCN : AP -> CN -> CN`` hides agreement, word order,...


Presentation: "school grammar" concepts, dictionary-like conventions
```
  bird_N = reg2N "Vogel" "Vögel" masculine
```
API = Application Programmer's Interface

Documentation: ``gfdoc`` 
- produces html from gf


IDE = Interactive Development Environment (forthcoming)
- library browser and syntax editor for grammar writing


Example-based grammar writing
```
  render Ita (parse Eng "you have k messages")
```


#NEW

===Scientific interest===

Linguistics
- definition of linguistic ontology
- describing language on this level of abstraction
- coping with different problems in different languages
- sharing concrete-syntax code between languages
- creating a resource for other NLP applications


Computer science
- datastructures for grammar rules
- type systems for grammars
- algorithms: parsing, generation, grammar compilation
- domain-specific programming language (GF)
- module system

==Coverage==

===Languages===

The current GF Resource Project covers ten languages:
- ``Dan``ish
- ``Eng``lish
- ``Fin``nish
- ``Fre``nch
- ``Ger``man
- ``Ita``lian
- ``Nor``wegian (bokmål)
- ``Rus``sian
- ``Spa``nish
- ``Swe``dish


In addition, parts (morphology) of Arabic, Estonian, Latin, and Urdu

API 1.0 not yet implemented for Danish and Russian



#NEW

===Morphology and lexicon===

Complete inflection engine
- all word classes
- all forms
- all inflectional paradigms


Basic lexicon
- 100 structural words
- 340 content words, mainly for testing
- these include the 207 [Swadesh words http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Swadesh_List]


It is more important to enable lexicon extensions than to 
provide a huge lexicon.
- technical lexica can have very special words, which tend to be regular





#NEW

===Syntactic structures===

Texts: 
sequences of phrases with punctuation

Phrases: 
declaratives, questions, imperatives, vocatives

Tense, mood, and polarity: 
present, past, future, conditional ; simultaneous, anterior ; positive, negative

Questions: 
yes-no, "wh" ; direct, indirect

Clauses: 
main, relative, embedded (subject, object, adverbial)

Verb phrases: 
intransitive, transitive, ditransitive, prepositional

Noun phrases: 
proper names, pronouns, determiners, possessives, cardinals and ordinals

===Language-dependent paradigm modules===

====Regular paradigms====

Every language implements these regular patterns that take
"dictionary forms" as arguments.
```
  regN : Str -> N
  regA : Str -> A 
  regV : Str -> V
```
Their usefulness varies. For instance, they
all are quite good in Finnish and English.
In Swedish, less so:
```
  regN "val" ---> val, valen, valar, valarna
```
Initializing a lexicon with ``regX``s is
usually a good starting point in grammar development.


#NEW

====Regular paradigms====

In Swedish, giving the gender of ``N`` improves a lot
```
  regGenN "val" neutrum ---> val, valet, val, valen
```

There are also special constructs taking other forms:
```
  mk2N : (nyckel,nycklar : Str) -> N

  mk1N : (bilarna : Str) -> N

  irregV : (dricka, drack, druckit : Str) -> V
```

Regular verbs are actually implemented the 
[Lexin http://lexin.nada.kth.se/sve-sve.shtml] way
```
  regV : (talar : Str) -> N
```


#NEW

====Worst-case paradigms====

To cover all situations, worst-case paradigms are given. E.g. Swedish
```
  mkN : (apa,apan,apor,aporna : Str) -> N

  mkA : (liten, litet, lilla, små, mindre, minst, minsta : Str) -> A

  mkV : (supa,super,sup,söp,supit,supen : Str) -> V
```


#NEW

====Irregular words====

Iregular words in ``IrregX``, e.g. Swedish:
```
    draga_V : V = 
      mkV (variants { "dra"; "draga"}) (variants { "drar" ; "drager"}) 
          (variants { "dra" ; "drag" }) "drog" "dragit" "dragen" ;
```
Goal: eliminate the user's need of worst-case functions.



#NEW

===Language-dependent syntax extensions===

Syntactic structures that are not shared by all languages.

Not implemented yet.

Candidates:
- ``Nor`` post-possessives: ``bilen min``
- ``Fre`` question forms: ``est-ce que tu dors ?``

#NEW

===How to use the resource as top-level grammar===

===Compiling===

It is a good idea to compile the library, so that it can be opened faster
```
  GF/lib/resource-1.0% make

  writes GF/lib/alltenses
         GF/lib/present
         GF/lib/resource-1.0/langs.gfcm
```
If you don't intend to change the library, you never need to process the source
files again. Just do some of
```
  gf -nocf langs.gfcm                                    -- all 8 languages
 
  gf -nocf -path=alltenses:prelude alltenses/LangSwe.gfc -- Swedish only

  gf -nocf -path=alltenses:prelude present/LangSwe.gfc   -- Swedish only, present tense only
```


#NEW

===Parsing===

The default parser does not work!

The MCFG parser works in some languages, after waiting appr. 20 seconds
```
  p -mcfg -lang=LangEng -cat=S "I would see her"

  p -mcfg -lang=LangSwe -cat=S "jag skulle se henne"
```
Parsing in ``present/`` versions is quicker.


#NEW

===Treebank generation===

Multilingual treebank entry = tree + linearizations

Some examples on treebank generation, assuming ``langs.gfcm``
```
  gr -cat=S   -number=10 -cf | tb                  -- 10 random S

  gt -cat=Phr -depth=4       | tb -xml | wf ex.xml -- all Phr to depth 4, into file ex.xml
```
Regression testing
```
  rf ex.xml | tb -c      -- read treebank from file and compare to present grammars 
```
Updating a treebank
```
  rf old.xml | tb -trees | tb -xml | wf new.xml    -- read old from file, write new to file
```



#NEW

===Treebank-based parsing===

Brute-force method that helps if real parsing is more expensive.
```
  make treebank                     -- make treebank with all languages

  gf -treebank langs.xml            -- start GF by reading the treebank

  > ut -strings -treebank=LangIta   -- show all Ita strings

  > ut -treebank=LangIta -raw "Quello non si romperebbe" -- look up a string

  > i -nocf langs.gfcm              -- read grammar to be able to linearize

  > ut -treebank=LangIta "Quello non si romperebbe" | l -multi  -- translate to all
```


#NEW

===Morphology===

Use morphological analyser
```
  gf -nocf -retain -path=alltenses:prelude alltenses/LangSwe.gf
  > ma "jag kan inte höra vad du säger"
```

Try out a morphology quiz
```
  > mq -cat=V
```

Try out inflection patterns
```
  gf -retain -path=alltenses:prelude alltenses/ParadigmsSwe.gfr
  > cc regV "lyser"
```



#NEW

===Syntax editing===

We start a demo by
``` gfeditor langs.gfcm

[editor.png]


#NEW

===Efficient parsing via application grammar===

Get rid of discontinuous constituents 

Examples: ``mathematical/Predication``, ``examples/bronzeage``


#NEW

==How to use as library==

===Specialization through parametrized modules===

The application grammar is implemented with reference to
the resource API

Individual languages are instantiations

Example: [tram ../../../examples/tram/TramI.gf]


#NEW

===Compile-time transfer===

Instead of parametrized modules:

select resource functions differently for different languages

Example: imperative vs. infinitive in mathematical exercises


#NEW

===A natural division into modules===

Lexicon in language-dependent moduls

Combination rules in a parametrized module

#NEW

===Example-based grammar writing===

Example: [animal ../../../examples/animal/QuestionsI.gfe]

#NEW

==How to implement a new language==

See [Resource-HOWTO Resource-HOWTO.html]

==Ordinary modules==

Write a concrete syntax module for each abstract module in the API

Write a ``Paradigms`` module

Examples: English, Finnish, German, Russian

#NEW

==Parametrized modules==

Examples: Romance (French, Italian, Spanish), Scandinavian (Danish, Norwegian, Swedish)

Write a ``Diff`` interface for a family of languages

Write concrete syntaxes as functors opening the interface

Write separate ``Paradigms`` modules for each language

Advantages:
- easier maintenance of library
- insights into language families


Problems:
- more abstract thinking required
- individual grammars may not come out optimal in elegance and efficiency


#NEW

===The core of the API===

Everything else is variations of this
```
cat
  Cl ;   -- clause
  VP ;   -- verb phrase
  V2 ;   -- two-place verb
  NP ;   -- noun phrase
  CN ;   -- common noun
  Det ;  -- determiner
  AP ;   -- adjectival phrase

fun
  PredVP  : NP  -> VP -> Cl ;   -- predication
  ComplV2 : V2  -> NP -> VP ;   -- complementization
  DetCN   : Det -> CN -> NP ;   -- determination
  ModCN   : AP  -> CN -> CN ;   -- modification
```

#NEW

===The core of the API===

This [toy Latin grammar  latin.gf] shows in a nutshell how the core
can be implemented.

Use this API as a first approximation when designing the parameter system of a new
language. 


#NEW

===How to proceed===

+ put up a directory with dummy modules by copying from e.g. English and
commenting out the contents

+ so you will have a compilable ``LangX`` all the time

+ start with nouns and their inflection

+ proceed to verbs and their inflection

+ add some noun phrases

+ implement predication


#NEW

==How to extend the API==

Extend old modules or add a new one?

Usually better to start a new one: then you don't have to implement it
for all languages at once.

Exception: if you are working with a language-specific API extension,
you can work directly in that module.
