#NEW

==Purpose==

===Library for applications===

High-level access to grammatical rules

E.g. //You have k new messages// rendered in ten languages //X//
```
  render X (Have (You (Number (k (New Message)))))
```

Usability for different purposes
- translation systems
- software localization
- dialogue systems
- language teaching


#NEW

===Grammar as parser===

Often in NLP, a grammar is just high-level code for a parser.

But writing a grammar can be inadequate for parsing:
- too much manual work
- too inefficient
- not robust
- too ambiguous


Moreover, a grammar fine-tuned for parsing may not be reusable
- for generation
- for specialized grammars
- as library


#NEW

===Grammar as language definition===

Linguistic ontology: **abstract syntax**

E.g. adjectival modification
```
  AdjCN : AP -> CN -> CN ;
```

Rendering in different languages: **concrete syntax**

Resource grammars have generation perspective, rather than parsing
- abstract syntax serves as a key to expressions in different languages



#NEW

===Usability by non-linguists===

Division of labour: resource grammars hide linguistic details

Presentation: "school grammar" concepts, dictionary-like conventions

API = Application Programmer's Interface

Documentation: ``gfdoc``

IDE = Interactive Development Environment (forthcoming)

Example-based grammar writing
```
  render Ita (parse Eng "you have k messages")
```


#NEW

===Scientific interest===

Linguistics
- definition of linguistic ontology
- coping with different problems in different languages
- sharing concrete-syntax code between languages
- creating a resource for other NLP applications


Computer science
- datastructures for grammar rules
- type systems for grammars
- algorithms: parsing, generation, grammar compilation
- domain-specific programming language (GF)
- module system



#NEW

==Coverage==

===Languages====

The current GF Resource Project covers ten languages:
- ``Dan``ish
- ``Eng``lish
- ``Fin``nish
- ``Fre``nch
- ``Ger``man
- ``Ita``lian
- ``Nor``wegian (bokmål)
- ``Rus``sian
- ``Spa``nish
- ``Swe``dish


In addition, parts (morphology) of Arabic, Estonian, Latin, and Urdu

API 1.0 not yet implemented for Danish and Russian



#NEW

===Morphology====

Complete inflection engine
- all word classes
- all forms
- all inflectional paradigms


High-level access via ``ParadigmsX``; e.g. Swedish:
- worst-case functions
```
    mkV : (supa,super,sup,söp,supit,supen : Str) -> V ;
```
- common patterns
```
    regV   : (talar : Str) -> V ;
    irregV : (dricka, drack, druckit : Str) -> V ;
```
- irregular words in ``IrregX``:
```
    draga_V : V = 
      mkV (variants { "dra"; "draga"}) (variants { "drar" ; "drager"}) 
          (variants { "dra" ; "drag" }) "drog" "dragit" "dragen" ;
```
