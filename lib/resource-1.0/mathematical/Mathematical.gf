--1 The Mathematics API to the Resource Grammar

-- This grammar is a collection of the different modules.
-- It differs from $Lang$ in two main ways:
-- - the combinations in Noun, Verb, Adjective, Adverb, Sentence are not included
-- - instead, Symbol and Predication are used
-- 
-- 
-- In practice, the most important difference is that only present-tense sentences
-- are included, and that symbolic expressions are recognized as NPs.
