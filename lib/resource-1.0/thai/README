Started Thai resource implementation following

  David Smyth, Thai An Essential Grammar,
    Routledge, London and New York, 2002.

Literal strings are defined as constants, all in the generated file

  StringsTha.gf

This file is obtained from

  StringsThai.gf

by

  make strings

using the transliteration defined in

  GF/src/GF/Text/Thai.hs

and documented in

  thai.html

From this, also approximate pronunciation can be derived.
We also plan to use this unique word list for segmenting
Thai strings.
