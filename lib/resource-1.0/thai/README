Started Thai resource implementation following

  David Smyth, Thai An Essential Grammar,
    Routledge, London and New York, 2002.

Literal strings are defined as constants, all in the generated file

  StringsTha.gf

This file is obtained by 'make strings' from

  StringsThai.gf

using the transliteration defined in GF/src/GF/Text/Thai.hs
and documented in thai.html.

From this, also approximate pronunciation can be derived.
Use then the command 'make pronstrings' and the main file

  LangThaiPron.gf

We also plan to use the unique word list for segmenting
Thai strings.
