--1 Romance Word Classes and Morphological Parameters
--

resource ParamRomance = ParamX ** open Prelude in {

-- This is a resource module for Romance grammars, currently instantiated for
-- French, Italian, and Spanish. It defines the
-- morphological parameters that are common to all Romance languages.
-- The guiding principle has been
-- to share as much as possible, which has two advantages: it saves work in
-- encoding, and it shows how the languages are related.
-- Those parameters that differ are defined in [DiffRomance DiffRomance.html].
-- Some parameters are shared even more widely, such as $Number$ and $Person$.
-- They are defined in [ParamX ParamX.html].


--2 Enumerated parameter types for morphology
--
-- These types are the ones found in school grammars.
-- Their parameter values are atomic.

param

  Gender = Masc | Fem ;

  Mood   = Indic | Conjunct ;

-- There are different types of clitic pronouns (as for position).
-- Examples of each: "Giovanni" ; "io" ; "lui" ; "noi".

  ClitType = Clit0 | Clit1 | Clit2 | Clit3 ;

-- Adjectives are inflected in gender and number, and there is also an 
-- adverbial form (e.g. "infiniment"), which has different paradigms and 
-- can even be irregular ("bien").
-- Comparative adjectives are moreover inflected in degree
-- (which in Romance is usually syntactic, though).

  AForm = AF Gender Number | AA ;

-- Gender is not morphologically determined for first and second person pronouns.

  PronGen = PGen Gender | PNoGen ;

-- The following coercions are useful:

oper
  prongen2gender : PronGen -> Gender = \p -> case p of {
    PGen g => g ;
    PNoGen => variants {Masc ; Fem} --- the best we can do for je, tu, nous, vous
    } ;


  aform2gender : AForm -> Gender = \a -> case a of {
    AF g _ => g ;
    _      => Masc -- "le plus lentement"
    } ;
  aform2number : AForm -> Number = \a -> case a of {
    AF _ n => n ;
    _      => Sg -- "le plus lentement"
    } ;

--3 Verbs 
--
-- In the current syntax, we use 
-- a reduced conjugation with only the present tense infinitive, 
-- indicative, subjunctive, and imperative forms.
-- But our morphology has full Bescherelle conjunctions:
-- so we use a coercion between full and reduced verbs.
-- The full conjugations and the coercions are defined separately for French
-- and Italian, since they are not identical. The differences are mostly due
-- to Bescherelle structuring the forms in different groups; the
-- gerund and the present participles show real differences.

    _ => <Sg,P3> ----
