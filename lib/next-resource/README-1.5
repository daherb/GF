GF Resource Grammar Library Version 1.5

This will be the next release of the library.

If you have new contributions and bug fixes in 1.4 - please also carry over the changes 
in 1.5! Preferably, work directly with 1.5.

The Syntax and Paradigms APIs are supersets of the old ones - thus backward compatibility
is guaranteed for applications using them. This of course with the reservation that, since
the APIs may contain new functions, name clashes with other modules may result if names are
not qualified.

Visible differences from 1.4:

- Cat, Noun : Quant and Art fused ; Quant has both substantival and adjectival forms. This
  is to eliminate the duplication of Quant and Art rules, and also to account for the different
  forms some quantifiers, have when the word stands alone vs. is attached to an adjective.
  For instance, in Italian, "that wine" is "quel vino", whereas "that" alone is "quello".

- CommonX, Sentence : Tense and Ant fused. This is to leave room for the radically different
  tense systems in different languages. However, the Syntax API still displays the 
  two-dimensional tense structure.

- Mathematical is dropped as obsolete. Combinators and Symbolic together give a sufficient
  interface for this kind of applications.

- Combinators is included in Syntax.
