VERSION NOTICE: this resource grammar library is at the moment of
writing the most complete one. It supersedes and includes
v 0.6 (../resource-0.6) in all other respects except that
it is not implemented for German.

HOWEVER, this library is no longer developed, but the
development has been moved to v 1.0 (../resource-1.0).
V 1.0 will replace v 0.9 during Winter and Spring 2006.
