--1 Rules for verbs and verb phrases
--
-- This module treats predications by means of deep right-branching
-- $VP$ structures, which have the advantage of conciseness but the
-- disadvantage of slow parsing due to discontinuous constituents.
--
-- The principal way of forming sentences ($S$) is by combining a noun phrase
-- with a verb phrase (the $PredVP$ rule below). In addition to this, verb
-- phrases have uses in relative clauses and questions. Verb phrases already
-- have (or have not) a negation, but they are formed from verbal groups
-- ($VG$), which have both positive and negative forms.
