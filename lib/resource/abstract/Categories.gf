--1 Abstract Syntax Categories for Multilingual Resource Grammar
--
-- Aarne Ranta 2002 -- 2004
--
-- Although concrete syntax differs a lot between different languages,
-- many structures can be treated as common, on the level
-- of abstraction that GF provides. 
-- What we will present in the following is a linguistically oriented abstract 
-- syntax that has been successfully defined for the following languages:
--
--* $Eng$lish
--* $Fin$nish
--* $Fre$nch
--* $Ger$man
--* $Ita$lian
--* $Rus$sian
--* $Swe$dish
--
-- The three-letter prefixes are used in file names all over the resource
-- grammar library; we refer to them commonly as $X$ below.
--!
-- The grammar has been applied to define language
-- fragments on technical or near-to-technical domains: database queries,
-- video recorder dialogue systems, software specifications, and a 
-- health-related phrase book. Each new application helped to identify some
-- missing structures in the resource and suggested some additions, but the
-- number of required additions was usually small.
-- 
-- To use the resource in applications, you need the following 
-- $cat$ and $fun$ rules in $oper$ form, completed by taking the
-- $lincat$ and $lin$ judgements of a particular language. This is done
-- by using, instead of this module, the $reuse$ module which has the name
-- $ResourceX$. It is located in the subdirectory
-- $lib/resource/lang$ where $lang$ is the full name of the language.

--2 Categories
--
-- The categories of this resource grammar are mostly 'standard' categories
-- of linguistics. Their is no claim that they correspond to semantic categories
-- definable in type theory: to define such correspondences is the business
-- of applications grammars. In general, the correspondence between linguistic
-- and semantic categories is many-to-many.
--
-- Categories that may look special are $A2$, $N2$, and $V2$. They are all
-- instances of endowing another category with a complement, which can be either
-- a direct object (whose case may vary) or a prepositional phrase. Prepositional
-- phrases that are not complements belong to the category
-- $Adv$ of adverbs.
--
-- In each group below, some categories are *lexical* in the sense of only
-- containing atomic elements. These elements are not necessarily expressed by
-- one word in all languages; the essential thing is that they have no
-- constituents. Thus they have no productions in this part of the 
-- resource grammar. The $ParadigmsX$ grammars provide ways of defining
-- lexical elements.
--
-- Lexical categories are listed before other categories
-- in each group and divided by an empty line.
