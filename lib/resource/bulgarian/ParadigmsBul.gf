--1 Bulgarian Lexical Paradigms
--
-- Krasimir Angelov 2008
--
-- This is an API for the user of the resource grammar 
-- for adding lexical items. It gives functions for forming
-- expressions of open categories: nouns, adjectives, verbs.
-- 
-- Closed categories (determiners, pronouns, conjunctions) are
-- accessed through the resource syntax API, $Structural.gf$. 
--
-- The main difference with $MorphoBul.gf$ is that the types
-- referred to are compiled resource grammar types. We have moreover
-- had the design principle of always having existing forms, rather
-- than stems, as string arguments of the paradigms.
--
-- The structure of functions for each word class $C$ is the following:
-- first we give a handful of patterns that aim to cover all
-- regular cases. Then we give a worst-case function $mkC$, which serves as an
-- escape to construct the most irregular words of type $C$.

--3 Two-place adjectives
--
-- Two-place adjectives need a preposition for their second argument.

  mkA2 : A -> Prep -> A2 ;

--2 Adverbs

-- Adverbs are not inflected. Most lexical ones have position
-- after the verb. Some can be preverbal (e.g. "always").

  mkAdv : Str -> Adv ;
  mkAdV : Str -> AdV ;

-- Adverbs modifying adjectives and sentences can also be formed.

  mkAdA : Str -> AdA ;

--2 Prepositions
--
-- A preposition as used for rection in the lexicon, as well as to
-- build $PP$s in the resource API, just requires a string.

  mkPrep : Str -> Case -> Prep ;
  noPrep : Prep ;

  mkA2 a p = a ** {c2 = p.s ; lock_A2 = <>} ;

--2 Verbs
--
  
--3 Two-place verbs
--
-- Two-place verbs need a preposition, except the special case with direct object.
-- (transitive verbs). Notice that a particle comes from the $V$.

  mkAdV x = ss x ** {lock_AdV = <>} ;
  mkAdA x = ss x ** {lock_AdA = <>} ;

  dirV2 : V -> V2 ;

--3 Three-place verbs
--
-- Three-place (ditransitive) verbs need two prepositions, of which
-- the first one or both can be absent.

  dirV3    : V -> Prep -> V3 ;           -- give,_,to
