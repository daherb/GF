=Browsing the libraries with GF commands=

**New**: Browsing by syntax editor 
[directly on the web ../../../demos/resource-api/editor.html].

All of the following assume
```
  cd $GF_LIB_PATH
```
To try out inflection paradigms:
```
  > i -path=alltenses:prelude -retain alltenses/ParadigmsGer.gfr
  > cc mkN "Farbe"
```
To try out overloaded syntax, test lexicon, and inflection paradigms:
```
  > i -path=alltenses:prelude -retain alltenses/TryGer.gfr
  > cc mkCl (mkNP this_QuantSg (mkN "Farbe")) (mkA "dunkel")
```
To look for a syntax tree in the overload API by parsing:
```
  > i -path=alltenses:prelude alltenses/OverLangEng.gfc
  > p -cat=S -overload "this grammar is too big"
```
To view linearizations in all languages by parsing from English:
```
  > i alltenses/langs.gfcm
  > p -cat=S -lang=LangEng "this grammar is too big" | tb
```
