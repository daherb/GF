This document contains the most important parts of the GF Resource Grammar API.
It has been machine-generated from the source files; each chapter gives a link
to the relevant source files, which give more information. Some of the files have
not yet been prepared so that the machine generated documentation has the right format.

Since the character encoding is UTF-8 for Russian and Latin-1 for other languages, you
may have to change the encoding preference of your browser when reading different
parts of the document.

The second-last chapter gives instructions on how to "browse" the library by 
loading the grammars into the ``gf`` command editor.

The last chapter contains a brief example of how application grammars can
import resource modules. At the same time, it illustrates a "design pattern" for 
using the resource API to build functor-based applications
