--1 A Small English Resource Syntax

-- This resource grammar contains definitions needed to construct

--2 Common Nouns
--
-- Simple common nouns are defined as the type $CommNoun$ in $morpho.Deu.gf$.

--3 Common noun phrases

-- To the common nouns of morphology,
-- we add natural gender (human/nonhuman) which is needed in syntactic
-- combinations (e.g. "man who runs" - "program which runs").

-- Genitives of noun phrases can be used like determiners, to build noun phrases.
-- The number argument makes the difference between "my house" - "my houses".

     p = P3 ; 
     n = Pl

-- Constructions like "the idea that two is even" are formed at the
-- first place as common nouns, so that one can also have "a suggestion that...".

  nounThatSentence : CommNounPhrase -> SS -> CommNounPhrase = \idea,x -> 
    {s = \\n,c => idea.s ! n ! c ++ "that" ++ x.s ; 
     g = idea.g
    } ;


--2 Adjectives
--
-- Adjectival phrases have a parameter $p$ telling if they are prefixed ($True$) or 
-- postfixed (complex APs). 

  AdjPhrase : Type = Adjective ** {p : Bool} ;

  adj2adjPhrase : Adjective -> AdjPhrase = \new -> new ** {p = True} ;

  simpleAdjPhrase : Str -> AdjPhrase = \French ->
    adj2adjPhrase (regAdjective French) ;


--3 Comparison adjectives
--
-- Each of the comparison forms has a characteristic use:
--
-- Positive forms are used alone, as adjectival phrases ("big").

  positAdjPhrase : AdjDegr -> AdjPhrase = \big -> 
    adj2adjPhrase {s = big.s ! Pos} ;

-- Comparative forms are used with an object of comparison, as
-- adjectival phrases ("bigger then you").

  comparAdjPhrase : AdjDegr -> NounPhrase -> AdjPhrase = \big, you ->
    {s = \\a => big.s ! Comp ! a ++ "than" ++ you.s ! NomP ; 
     p = False
    } ;

-- Superlative forms are used with a modified noun, picking out the
-- maximal representative of a domain ("the biggest house").

  superlNounPhrase : AdjDegr -> CommNoun -> NounPhrase = \big, house ->
    {s = \\c => "the" ++ big.s ! Sup ! AAdj ++ house.s ! Sg ! toCase c ; 
     n = Sg ; 
     p = P3
    } ;

-- Moreover, superlatives can be used alone as adjectival phrases
-- ("the youngest" - in free variation). 

  superlAdjPhrase : AdjDegr -> AdjPhrase = \big ->
    {s = \\a => "the" ++ big.s ! Sup ! a ; 
     p = True
    } ;

--3 Two-place adjectives
--
-- A two-place adjective is an adjective with a preposition used before
-- the complement.

  Preposition = Str ;

  AdjCompl = Adjective ** {s2 : Preposition} ;

  complAdj : AdjCompl -> NounPhrase -> AdjPhrase = \related,john ->
    {s = \\a => related.s ! a ++ related.s2 ++ john.s ! AccP ; 
     p = False
    } ;


--3 Modification of common nouns
--
-- The two main functions of adjective are in predication ("John is old")
-- and in modification ("an old man"). Predication will be defined
-- later, in the chapter on verbs.
--
-- Modification must pay attention to pre- and post-noun
-- adjectives: "big car"/"car bigger than X"

  modCommNounPhrase : AdjPhrase -> CommNounPhrase -> CommNounPhrase = \big, car -> 
    {s = \\n => if_then_else (Case => Str) big.p 
           (\\c => big.s ! AAdj ++ car.s ! n ! c)
           (table {Nom => car.s ! n ! Nom ++ big.s ! AAdj ; Gen => variants {}}) ;
     g = car.g
    } ;


--2 Function expressions

-- A function expression is a common noun together with the
-- preposition prefixed to its argument ("mother of x").
-- The type is analogous to two-place adjectives and transitive verbs.

  Function = CommNounPhrase ** {s2 : Preposition} ;

-- The application of a function gives, in the first place, a common noun:
-- "mother/mothers of John". From this, other rules of the resource grammar 
-- give noun phrases, such as "the mother of John", "the mothers of John",
-- "the mothers of John and Mary", and "the mother of John and Mary" (the
-- latter two corresponding to distributive and collective functions,
-- respectively). Semantics will eventually tell when each
-- of the readings is meaningful.

  appFunComm : Function -> NounPhrase -> CommNounPhrase = \mother,john -> 
    {s = \\n => table {
            Gen => nonExist ; --- ?
            _ => mother.s ! n ! Nom ++ mother.s2 ++ john.s ! GenSP 
            } ;
     g = mother.g
    } ;

-- It is possible to use a function word as a common noun; the semantics is
-- often existential or indexical.

  funAsCommNounPhrase : Function -> CommNounPhrase = 
    noun2CommNounPhrase ;

-- The following is an aggregate corresponding to the original function application
-- producing "John's mother" and "the mother of John". It does not appear in the
-- resource grammar API any longer.

  appFun : Bool -> Function -> NounPhrase -> NounPhrase = \coll, mother,john -> 
    let {n = john.n ; nf = if_then_else Number coll Sg n} in 
    variants {
      defNounPhrase nf (appFunComm mother john) ;
      npGenDet nf noNum john mother
      } ;

-- The commonest case is functions with the preposition  "of".

  funOf : CommNoun -> Function = \mother -> 
    mother ** {s2 = "of"} ;

  funOfReg : Str -> Gender -> Function = \mother,g -> 
    funOf (nounReg mother ** {g = g}) ;

-- Two-place functions add one argument place.

  Function2 = Function ** {s3 : Preposition} ;

-- There application starts by filling the first place.

  appFun2 : Function2 -> NounPhrase -> Function = \train, paris ->
    {s  = \\n,c => train.s ! n ! c ++ train.s2 ++ paris.s ! AccP ;
     g  = train.g ;
     s2 = train.s3
    } ;

--3 Transitive verbs
--
-- Transitive verbs are verbs with a preposition for the complement,

-- "transitive" traditionally means that the inherent preposition is empty.
-- Such a verb is one with a *direct object*.

-- Verbs that take direct object, no particle:

  mkTransVerbDir : VerbP3 -> TransVerb = \love -> 
    mkTransVerbPart love [] ;

-- Transitive verbs with accusative objects can be used passively. 
-- The function does not check that the verb is transitive.
-- Therefore, the function can also be used for "he is swum", etc.
-- The syntax is the same as for adjectival predication.

  passVerb : Verb -> VerbGroup = \love ->

--3 Conjunctions

-- Coordinated phrases are built by using conjunctions, which are either
-- simple ("and", "or") or distributed ("both - and", "either - or").
--
-- The conjunction has an inherent number, which is used when conjoining
-- noun phrases: "John and Mary are..." vs. "John or Mary is..."; in the
-- case of "or", the result is however plural if any of the disjuncts is.

-- category, the parts corresponding to 'init' and 'last' segments
-- (rather than 'head' and 'tail', because we have to keep track of the slot between
-- the last two elements of the list). A list has at least two elements.

    ss (CO.conjunctX c xs) ;

-- To coordinate a list of sentences by a distributed conjunction, we place
