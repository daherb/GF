--1 English Lexical Paradigms UNDER RECONSTRUCTION!
--
-- Aarne Ranta 2003
--
-- This is an API to the user of the resource grammar 
-- for adding lexical items. It gives functions for forming
-- expressions of open categories: nouns, adjectives, verbs.
-- 
-- Closed categories (determiners, pronouns, conjunctions) are
-- accessed through the resource syntax API, $Structural.gf$. 
--
-- The main difference with $MorphoEng.gf$ is that the types
-- referred to are compiled resource grammar types. We have moreover
-- had the design principle of always having existing forms, rather
-- than stems, as string arguments of the paradigms.
--
-- The structure of functions for each word class $C$ is the following:
-- first we give a handful of patterns that aim to cover all
-- regular cases. Then we give a worst-case function $mkC$, which serves as an
-- escape to construct the most irregular words of type $C$.
-- However, this function should only seldom be needed: we have a
-- separate module $IrregularEng$, which covers all irregularly inflected
-- words.
-- 
-- The following modules are presupposed:

resource ParadigmsEng = open (Predef=Predef), Prelude, SyntaxEng, ResourceEng in {

--2 Parameters 
--
-- To abstract over gender names, we define the following identifiers.

oper
  Gender : Type ; 

  human    : Gender ;
  nonhuman : Gender ;

-- To abstract over number names, we define the following.

  Number : Type ; 

  singular : Number ;
  plural   : Number ;

-- To abstract over case names, we define the following.

  Case : Type ;

  nominative : Case ;
  genitive   : Case ;


--2 Nouns

-- The regular function captures the variants for nouns ending with
-- "s","sh","x","z" or "y": "kiss - kisses", "flash - flashes"; 
-- "fly - flies" (but "toy - toys"),

  regN : Str -> N ;

-- Worst case: give all four forms and the semantic gender.

  mkN  : (man,men,man's,men's : Str) -> N ;

-- In practice the worst case is just: give singular and plural nominative.

  manN : (man,men : Str) -> N ;

-- All nouns created by the previous functions are marked as
-- $nonhuman$. If you want a $human$ noun, wrap it with the following
-- function:

  humanN : N -> N ;

--3 Compound nouns 
--
-- All the functions above work quite as well to form compound nouns,
-- such as "baby boom". 


--3 Relational nouns 
-- 
-- Relational nouns ("daughter of x") need a preposition. 

  mkN2 : N -> Prep -> N2 ;

-- The most common preposition is "of", and the following is a
-- shortcut for regulat, $nonhuman$ relational nouns with "of".

  regN2 : Str -> N2 ;

-- Use the function $mkPrep$ or see the section on prepositions below to  
-- form other prepositions.
--
-- Three-place relational nouns ("the connection from x to y") need two prepositions.

  mkN3 : N -> Prep -> Prep -> N3 ;

--3 Relational common noun phrases
--
-- In some cases, you may want to make a complex $CN$ into a
-- relational noun (e.g. "the old town hall of").

  cnN2 : CN -> Prep -> N2 ;
  cnN3 : CN -> Prep -> Prep -> N3 ;

-- 
--3 Proper names
--
-- Proper names, with a regular genitive, are formed as follows

  pnReg : Str -> PN ;          -- John, John's

--2 Adjectives

-- Non-comparison one-place adjectives need two forms: one for
-- the adjectival and one for the adverbial form ("free - freely")

  mkA : (free,freely : Str) -> A ;

-- For regular adjectives, the adverbial form is derived. This holds
-- even for cases with the variation "happy - happily".

  regA : Str -> A ;
 
--3 Two-place adjectives
--
-- Two-place adjectives need a preposition for their second argument.

  mkA2 : A -> Prep -> A2 ;

-- Comparison adjectives may two more forms. 

  mkADeg : (good,better,best,well : Str) -> ADeg ;

-- The regular pattern recognizes two common variations: 
-- "-e" ("rude" - "ruder" - "rudest") and
-- "-y" ("happy - happier - happiest - happily")

  regADeg : Str -> ADeg ;      -- long, longer, longest

-- However, the duplication of the final consonant is nor predicted,
-- but a separate pattern is used:

  fatADeg : Str -> ADeg ;      -- fat, fatter, fattest

-- If comparison is formed by "more, "most", as in general for
-- long adjective, the following pattern is used:

  compoundADeg : A -> ADeg ; -- -/more/most ridiculous

-- From a given $ADeg$, it is possible to get back to $A$.

  adegA : ADeg -> A ;


--2 Adverbs

-- Adverbs are not inflected. Most lexical ones have position
-- after the verb. Some can be preverbal (e.g. "always").

  mkAdv  : Str -> Adv ;
  preAdv : Str -> Adv ;

-- Adverbs modifying adjectives and sentences can also be formed.

  mkAdA : Str -> AdA ;
  mkAdS : Str -> AdS ;

--2 Prepositions
--
-- A preposition is just a string.

  mkPrep : Str -> Prep ;

--2 Verbs
--
-- Except for "be", the worst case needs five forms: the infinitive and
-- the third person singular present, the past indicative, and the
-- past and present participles.

  mkV : (go, goes, went, gone, going : Str) -> V ;

-- The regular verb function recognizes the special cases where the last
-- character is "y" ("cry - cries" but "buy - buys") or "s", "sh", "x", "z"
-- ("fix - fixes", etc).

  regV : Str -> V ;

-- There is an extensive list of irregular verbs in the module $IrregularEng$.
-- In practice, it is enough to give three forms, 
-- e.g. "drink - drank - drunk", with a variant indicating consonant
-- duplication in the present participle.

  irregV     : (drink, drank, drunk  : Str) -> V ;
  irregDuplV : (get,   got,   gotten : Str) -> V ;


--3 Verbs with a particle.
--
-- The particle, such as in "switch on", is given as a string.

  partV  : V -> Str -> V ;

--3 Two-place verbs
--
-- Two-place verbs need a preposition, except the special case with direct object.
-- (transitive verbs). Notice that a particle comes from the $V$.

  mkV2  : V -> Prep -> V2 ;

  dirV2 : V -> V2 ;

--3 Three-place verbs
--
-- Three-place (ditransitive) verbs need two prepositions, of which
-- the first one or both can be absent.

  mkV3     : V -> Str -> Str -> V3 ;    -- speak, with, about
  dirV3    : V -> Str -> V3 ;           -- give,_,to
  dirdirV3 : V -> V3 ;                  -- give,_,_

--2 Definitions of paradigms
--
-- The definitions should not bother the user of the API. So they are
-- hidden from the document.
