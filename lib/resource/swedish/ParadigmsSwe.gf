--1 Swedish Lexical Paradigms UNDER RECONSTRUCTION!
--
-- Aarne Ranta 2003
--
-- This is an API to the user of the resource grammar 
-- for adding lexical items. It gives functions for forming
-- expressions of open categories: nouns, adjectives, verbs.
-- 
-- Closed categories (determiners, pronouns, conjunctions) are
-- accessed through the resource syntax API, $Structural.gf$. 
--
-- The main difference with $MorphoEng.gf$ is that the types
-- referred to are compiled resource grammar types. We have moreover
-- had the design principle of always having existing forms, rather
-- than stems, as string arguments of the paradigms.
--
-- The structure of functions for each word class $C$ is the following:
-- first we give a handful of patterns that aim to cover all
-- regular cases. Then we give a worst-case function $mkC$, which serves as an
-- escape to construct the most irregular words of type $C$.
-- However, this function should only seldom be needed: we have a
-- separate module $IrregularEng$, which covers all irregularly inflected
-- words.
-- 
-- The following modules are presupposed:

resource ParadigmsSwe = 
  open (Predef=Predef), Prelude, TypesSwe, MorphoSwe, SyntaxSwe, ResourceSwe in {

--2 Parameters 
--
-- To abstract over gender names, we define the following identifiers.

oper
  Gender : Type ; 

  utrum     : Gender ;
  neutrum   : Gender ;

-- To abstract over number names, we define the following.

  Number : Type ; 

  singular : Number ;
  plural   : Number ;

-- To abstract over case names, we define the following.

  Case : Type ;

  nominative : Case ;
  genitive   : Case ;

-- Prepositions used in many-argument functions are just strings.

  Preposition : Type = Str ;

--2 Nouns

-- Worst case: give all four forms. The gender is computed from the
-- last letter of the second form (if "n", then $utrum$, otherwise $neutrum$).

  mkN  : (apa,apan,apor,aporna : Str) -> N ;

-- The regular function takes the singular indefinite form and the gender,
-- and computes the other forms by a heuristic. 
-- If in doubt, use the $cc$ command to test!

  regN : Str -> Gender -> N ;

-- In practice the worst case is often just: give singular and plural indefinite.

  mk2N : (nyckel,nycklar : Str) -> N ;

-- All nouns created by the previous functions are marked as
-- $nonmasculine$. If you want a $masculine$ noun, wrap it with the following
-- function:

  mascN : N -> N ;

--3 Compound nouns 
--
-- All the functions above work quite as well to form compound nouns,
-- such as "fotboll". 


--3 Relational nouns 
-- 
-- Relational nouns ("daughter of x") need a preposition. 

  mkN2 : N -> Preposition -> N2 ;

-- The most common preposition is "av", and the following is a
-- shortcut for regular, $nonhuman$ relational nouns with "av".

  regN2 : Str -> Gender -> N2 ;

-- Use the function $mkPreposition$ or see the section on prepositions below to  
-- form other prepositions.
--
-- Three-place relational nouns ("the connection from x to y") need two prepositions.

  mkN3 : N -> Preposition -> Preposition -> N3 ;


--3 Relational common noun phrases
--
-- In some cases, you may want to make a complex $CN$ into a
-- relational noun (e.g. "the old town hall of"). However, $N2$ and
-- $N3$ are purely lexical categories. But you can use the $AdvCN$
-- and $PrepNP$ constructions to build phrases like this.

-- 
--3 Proper names and noun phrases
--
-- Proper names, with a regular genitive, are formed as follows

  regPN : Str -> Gender -> PN ;          -- John, John's

-- Sometimes you can reuse a common noun as a proper name, e.g. "Bank".

  nounPN : N -> PN ;

-- To form a noun phrase that can also be plural and have an irregular
-- genitive, you can use the worst-case function.

  mkNP : Str -> Str -> Number -> Gender -> NP ; 

--2 Adjectives

-- Non-comparison one-place adjectives need for forms: 

  mkA : (galen,galet,galna : Str) -> A ;

-- For regular adjectives, the other forms are derived. 

  regA : Str -> A ;

-- In practice, two forms are enough.

  mk2A : (bred,brett : Str) -> A ;
 
--3 Two-place adjectives
--
-- Two-place adjectives need a preposition for their second argument.

  mkA2 : A -> Preposition -> A2 ;

-- Comparison adjectives may need as many as seven forms. 

  mkADeg : (liten, litet, lilla, sma, mindre, minst, minsta : Str) -> ADeg ;

-- The regular pattern works for many adjectives, e.g. those ending
-- with "ig".

  regADeg : Str -> ADeg ;

-- Just the comparison forms can be irregular.

  irregADeg : (tung,tyngre,tyngst : Str) -> ADeg ;

-- Sometimes just the positive forms are irregular.

  mk3ADeg : (galen,galet,galna : Str) -> ADeg ;
  mk2ADeg : (bred,brett        : Str) -> ADeg ;

-- If comparison is formed by "more, "most", as in general for
-- long adjective, the following pattern is used:

  compoundADeg : A -> ADeg ; -- -/more/most ridiculous

-- From a given $ADeg$, it is possible to get back to $A$.

  adegA : ADeg -> A ;


--2 Adverbs

-- Adverbs are not inflected. Most lexical ones have position
-- after the verb. Some can be preverbal (e.g. "always").

  mkAdv : Str -> Adv ;
  mkAdV : Str -> AdV ;

-- Adverbs modifying adjectives and sentences can also be formed.

  mkAdA : Str -> AdA ;

--2 Prepositions
--
-- A preposition is just a string.

  mkPreposition : Str -> Preposition ;

--2 Verbs
--
-- The worst case needs five forms.

  mkV : (supa,super,sup,söp,supit,supen : Str) -> V ;

-- The 'regular verb' function is the first conjugation.

  regV : (tala : Str) -> V ;

-- The almost regular verb function needs the infinitive and the present.

  mk2V : (leka,leker : Str) -> V ;

-- There is an extensive list of irregular verbs in the module $IrregularSwe$.
-- In practice, it is enough to give three forms, as in school books.

  irregV     : (dricka, drack, druckit  : Str) -> V ;


--3 Verbs with a particle.
--
-- The particle, such as in "switch on", is given as a string.

  partV  : V -> Str -> V ;

--3 Deponent verbs.
--
-- Some words are used in passive forms only, e.g. "hoppas".

  depV  : V -> V ;

--3 Two-place verbs
--
-- Two-place verbs need a preposition, except the special case with direct object.
-- (transitive verbs). Notice that a particle comes from the $V$.

  mkV2  : V -> Preposition -> V2 ;

  dirV2 : V -> V2 ;

--3 Three-place verbs
--
-- Three-place (ditransitive) verbs need two prepositions, of which
-- the first one or both can be absent.

  mkV3     : V -> Str -> Str -> V3 ;    -- speak, with, about
  dirV3    : V -> Str -> V3 ;           -- give,_,to
  dirdirV3 : V -> V3 ;                  -- give,_,_

--3 Other complement patterns
--
-- Verbs and adjectives can take complements such as sentences,
-- questions, verb phrases, and adjectives.

  mkV0  : V -> V0 ;
  mkVS  : V -> VS ;
  mkV2S : V -> Str -> V2S ;
  mkVV  : V -> VV ;
  mkV2V : V -> Str -> Str -> V2V ;
  mkVA  : V -> VA ;
  mkV2A : V -> Str -> V2A ;
  mkVQ  : V -> VQ ;
  mkV2Q : V -> Str -> V2Q ;

  mkAS  : A -> AS ;
  mkA2S : A -> Str -> A2S ;
  mkAV  : A -> AV ;
  mkA2V : A -> Str -> A2V ;

-- The definitions should not bother the user of the API. So they are
