<h1>The GF Eclipse Plugin</h1>

<p>John  J. Camilleri<br />
Updated: 12 June 2012</p>

<p><em>The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union&#8217;s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no. FP7-ICT-247914 (the <a href="http://www.molto-project.eu/">MOLTO Project</a>).</em></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The aim behind developing a desktop IDE for GF is to provide more powerful tools than may be possible and/or practical in a web-based environment (the <a href="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/demos/gfse/">GF Web IDE</a>). In particular, the ability to resolve identifier cross-references and browse external libraries quickly during development time is one of the primary motivations for the project.</p>

<p>The choice was made to develop this desktop IDE as a plugin for the Eclipse Platform as it emerged as the most popular choice among the GF developer community. Support for the platform is vast and many tools for adapting Eclipse to domain-specific languages already exist. Unlike the zero-click Web IDE approach, using the GF Eclipse plugin requires some manual installation and configuration on the development machine.</p>

<h2>Installation &amp; updating</h2>

<h3>System requirements</h3>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse</a> 3.6 or above.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/download/release-3.3.3.html">GF 3.3.3</a> or above. The path to GF must be set within the plugin preferences (see below).</li>
</ol>

<p>Using the GF Resource Grammar Library requires that the RGL binaries are also installed on your system.
If you are using the <a href="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/download/index.html">pre-compiled binaries</a> but have separately downloaded the RGL sources to your system, you can optionally specify this path in the plugin preferences (see below).</p>

<h3>Installing the plugin for the first time</h3>

<h4>Available Software Sites</h4>

<p>In order for dependencies to be satisfied, you need to ensure that your Eclipse has the following update site URLs set:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eclipse releases (change version name to match): <code>http://download.eclipse.org/releases/indigo</code></li>
<li>Xtext: <code>http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/tmf/xtext/updates/composite/releases/</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You can set these from <strong>Preferences &rarr; Install/Update &rarr; Available Software Sites</strong>.</p>

<h4>Eclipse preferences</h4>

<p>How to find the <strong>Eclipse preferences</strong> window depends on your Eclipse version and/or OS, and may be either of:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Window &rarr; Preferences</strong></li>
<li><strong>Eclipse &rarr; Preferences</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<ol>
<li>Inside Eclipse, go to <strong>Help &rarr; Install New Software</strong>.</li>
<li>Add new software site using the URL: <code>http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/release/</code></li>
<li>Select the <strong>GF Eclipse Plugin</strong>, and make sure the <strong>Contact all update sites during install to find required software</strong> option is checked.</li>
<li>Click Next, accept the license agreement and install.</li>
<li>Accept the prompt warning that the software is unsigned.</li>
<li>Restart Eclipse when prompted.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Settings</h4>

<ol>
<li>Add the GF perspective by clicking <strong>Window &rarr; Open Perspective &rarr; Other</strong> and choosing <strong>GF</strong>.</li>
<li>Open the plugin settings by going to <strong>Preferences &rarr; Grammatical Framework</strong> (image below).</li>
<li>The plugin will try to determine the path to your GF executable automatically, but this may need to be corrected.<br />
The path should include the name of the GF binary itself, e.g. <code>/home/john/.cabal/bin/gf</code> or <code>C:\Users\John\GF\bin\gf.exe</code>.</li>
<li>The <em>Additional path directive</em> setting can be used if you want to avoid writing <code>--# -path=...</code> directives in your source files. By default it is set to <code>.:alltenses:prelude</code>, but can also be left blank. This is passed to GF using the <code>--path</code> flag.</li>
<li>If you are using a pre-compiled version of the Resource Grammar Library (i.e. you didn&#8217;t build it from source yourself) but you have the sources available on your system, then you can enter their path in the <em>Library source path</em> setting. This is optional and is only used for jumping to source definitions.<br />
You should enter an absolute system path, up to and including the <code>src</code> folder, e.g. <code>/home/john/GF/lib/src/</code> or <code>C:\Users\John\GF\lib\src\</code>.</li>
<li>You can also adjust the verbosity level of the GFEP console log in the preferences window.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/images/eclipse-preferences.png" alt="Plugin preferences window" /></p>

<h3>Updating the plugin</h3>

<ol>
<li>In Eclipse, go to <strong>Help &rarr; Check for updates</strong>.</li>
<li>Any available updates will appear in the dialog. Select them and follow the usual steps.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Deprecated stuff</h4>

<ul>
<li>Any folders <code>.gfexternal</code> can safely deleted as of GFEP &ge; 1.5. Using Eclipse&#8217;s <strong>Clean</strong> function from the <strong>Run</strong> menu will do this for you automatically.</li>
<li>If your project has a folder named <code>(External)</code> you can safely delete this <strong>via the Eclipse Project Explorer</strong>. It is no longer used in GFEP &ge; 1.2.3</li>
<li>If your workspace contains a log file <code>gfep.log</code> then you can safely delete it from your system. As of version 1.2.4, GFEP uses Eclipse&#8217;s standard log file at <code>&lt;workspace&gt;/.metadata/.log</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>Project settings</h3>

<p>Although the plugin should take care of your project settings for you, in case anything gets messed up you can always correct them manually as follows:</p>

<h4>Project nature</h4>

<p>Your <code>.project</code> file should include the GF Project Nature as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;natures&gt;
  &lt;nature&gt;org.grammaticalframework.eclipse.ui.natures.projectNatureID&lt;/nature&gt;
&lt;/natures&gt;
</code></pre>

<h4>Builder</h4>

<p>Your <code>.project</code> file should include the GF Builder as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;buildSpec&gt;
  &lt;buildCommand&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;org.grammaticalframework.eclipse.ui.build.GFBuilderID&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;arguments&gt;
      &lt;/arguments&gt;
  &lt;/buildCommand&gt;
&lt;/buildSpec&gt;
</code></pre>

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>Some steps you can follow to get a feel of of the plugin&#8217;s features.</p>

<h3>Video tutorial</h3>

<p>A quick run through of the major features available in the GF Eclipse Plugin.</p>

<p><em>If the video doesn&#8217;t appear above, you can view it at <a href="https://vimeo.com/38768382">https://vimeo.com/38768382</a></em></p>

<h3>The Eclipse <em>workspace</em> and <em>project</em> concepts</h3>

<p>When you run Eclipse, it asks you to create or specify a <em>workspace</em> on your system, which is essentially the top directory that Eclipse will &#8220;see&#8221;. Any code you wish to work on inside Eclipse must reside in this workspace.
A workspace contains one or more <em>projects</em>, which may or may not be related to each other. Generally each folder under the top-level workspace directory is considered an individual project, i.e.:</p>

<pre><code>workspace/
    Project1/
        file1-1.gf
        file1-2.gf
    Project2/
        subdir2-1/
            file2-1-1.gf
            file2-1-2.gf
        file2-1.gf
        file2-2.gf
</code></pre>

<p>If you open an existing folder as your workspace in Eclipse, then your folders in that workspace <strong>do not</strong> automatically become Eclipse projects.
To do this, you must follow the &#8220;Create new GF Project&#8221; wizard below, and give your project the exact name of the existing folder (e.g. <code>Project1</code> or <code>Project2</code> in the example above.)</p>

<h4>GF Nature</h4>

<p>The <em>GF Nature</em> is what makes a regular Eclipse project a <em>GF</em> project.
If you create a new GF Project from scratch then you don&#8217;t need to worry too much about them.
If you already have some project set up in your Eclipse workspace, then you will need to associate the builder with your project in order for all the GF goodness to work.
This will internally add the <em>GF Builder</em> to your project also.</p>

<p>As of 1.4.2, this can be done very easily by right-clicking on your project in the explorer and clicking <strong>Add/Remove GF Nature</strong>.
If your project has the GF icon overlayed on it, then the GF nature and builder are correctly associated with it.</p>

<p>See the <strong>project settings</strong> section above if you want to mess with your <code>.project</code> file.</p>

<h4>Metadata folders</h4>

<p>GFEP will create the following metadata directories within your project:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <code>.gfbuild</code> directory in every folder containing GF source code, containing <code>.gf-tags</code> files created using the GF <code>--tags</code> compiler flag.</li>
</ul>

<p>These can be removed manually at any time, as they will always be regenerated as necessary.
You will probably want to ignore these directories in your version control system.</p>

<h3>Create a new GF Project</h3>

<p>If you have a folder in your workspace which you want to convert into a GF Project, then you can select it from the drop-down. This folder will then appear as an Eclipse project in your workspace.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/images/eclipse-projectwizard-1.png" alt="New project wizard" />
<img src="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/images/eclipse-projectwizard-2.png" alt="New project wizard" /></p>

<h3>New module wizard</h3>

<p>Use the <strong>GF Module</strong> wizard from <strong>File &rarr; New &rarr; Other &rarr; GF Module</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/images/eclipse-modulewizard-1.png" alt="New module wizard" /></p>

<p>You can find some small examples <a href="https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-eclipse-plugin/tree/master/workspace-demo/GF%20Project">here</a>. Download the files and manually add them to your Eclipse workspace to experiment with some of the plugin features.</p>

<h3>Clone module wizard</h3>

<p>If you want to clone an existing module into a new language, you can now do so via the <strong>Clone GF Module</strong> wizard. This is also available as a context menu option in the <strong>Project Explorer</strong>, via <strong>&lt;Right click&gt; &rarr; Grammatical Framework &rarr; Compile for new language</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/images/eclipse-clonewizard.png" alt="Clone GF module to new language wizard" /></p>

<p>This will create and open a new module with the relevant replacements made. Note how in this case string constants are replaced by the empty string <code>""</code>. This wizard currently only works on <code>concrete</code> and <code>instance</code> modules.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/images/eclipse-clonewizard-newfile.png" alt="Newly cloned file" /></p>

<h3>Workbench editor layout</h3>

<p>Use Eclipse&#8217; own features to drag and drop your editor tabs to suit your needs.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/images/eclipse-editor-general.png" alt="The editor and outline view" /></p>

<h3>Outline view</h3>

<p>The <strong>Outline</strong> view in the bottom-left offers a quite overview of your module structure. Clicking any of the terms will make your cursor jump to that point in the file.</p>

<h3>Cross-referencing errors and warnings</h3>

<p>Notice how changing a <code>cat</code> definition for example will produce warnings and/or errors in other the modules.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/images/eclipse-editor-cat.png" alt="Warnings and errors in the editor" /></p>

<h3>Validation</h3>

<p>The in-editor validation sometimes needs to be triggered/updated by a keystroke. If you can still see errors which you believe should be correct, try adding a space character to ensure the validation is re-triggered.</p>

<p>Sometimes you may get an entire file marked with errors, even though in fact there is only a single error which is causing the internal builder to fail. In such cases referring to the <strong>Problems</strong> view should help you locate the cause. This issue is particularly relevant when changes made to one module may induce errors in its descendants (e.g. renaming a parameter in a resource module). This behaviour will hopefully be improved in future versions.</p>

<h4>Builder</h4>

<p>For validation to work correctly, the project&#8217;s <strong>Build Automatically</strong> option should be turned on.
Each time you save a file (or some other change occurs in your project), the builder should get triggered which re-compiles any GF files which have changed. If the builder does not seem to get triggered, try to run a <em>clean</em> via <strong>Project &rarr; Clean&#8230;</strong></p>

<h3>Code formatting</h3>

<p>Use the built-in code formatter to tidy your code automatically. Right-click in the editor and choose <strong>Format</strong> or use the keyboard shortcut <strong>Ctrl+Shift+F</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/images/eclipse-before-format.png" alt="Before auto-formatting" /> <img src="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/images/eclipse-after-format.png" alt="After auto-formatting" /></p>

<h3>Syntax highlighting</h3>

<p>You can change your syntax colouring styles as you wish from <strong>Preferences &rarr; Grammatical Framework &rarr; Syntax Coloring</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/images/eclipse-syntaxcoloring.png" alt="Syntax highlighting styles" /></p>

<h3>Launch configurations</h3>

<p>Set up a launch configuration from <strong>Run &rarr; Run Configurations&#8230; &rarr; Grammatical Framework</strong>. You will see the dialog below with some fields automatically filled in for you.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/images/eclipse-launchconfig.png" alt="Launch configuration dialog" /></p>

<p>Run the launch config and you will see the output from the GF compiler in the console view within Eclipse.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/images/eclipse-compileroutput.png" alt="Output from the GF compiler" /></p>

<h4>Run As&#8230; launch shortcut</h4>

<p>Using the <strong>Run &rarr; Run As &rarr; Compile with GF</strong> shortcut will take the current selection or active editor and do one of two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>If a launch configuration already exists which the current file in its <em>Source filenames</em> field, then that config will be launch directly.</li>
<li>Otherwise, a new a launch configuration window is displayed where you will need to review and confirm the default settings before continuing.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Consoles</h3>

<p>The plugin provides its own console view named <em>GFEP Log</em>, which shows log messages based on the <strong>Log Level</strong> preference (<strong>Preferences &rarr; Grammatical Framework</strong>).</p>

<p>Additionally, every time a grammar is <strong>Run</strong> a <em>new</em> console is opened to display the output. This console may also serve as the interactive GF Shell, depending on the <strong>Interactive Mode</strong> checkbox in your <strong>Run Configuration</strong>.</p>

<p>Eclipse does not make it obvious when multiple console windows open; click on the <strong>Display Selected Console</strong> button to switch between open consoles:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/images/eclipse-console-icon.png" alt="Display Selected Console icon" /></p>

<p>If the process associated with a console window has terminated, it will be indicated in the upper-left corner as below. Such console windows can then be closed using the grey cross button:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/images/eclipse-console-terminated.png" alt="Close terminated console icon" /></p>

<p><em>The Eclipse console implementation does not support command history (up arrow) or auto-completion (tab).</em></p>

<h3><em>External Libraries</em> view</h3>

<p>This view is automatically populated with a list of all the external modules referenced by the current file. Double-clicking on any item provides a quick way of opening GF files which are imported into your grammar from outside your Eclipse project, for example the GF Resource Grammar Library.</p>

<p>This view also provides a text box for searching within the current module&#8217;s scope, as shown in the image below. Clicking the small arrow on the right-hand side of the view provides options for case sensitive and/or regular-expression based search.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/images/eclipse-external-libraries.png" alt="External libraries view" /></p>

<h3><em>Test Manager</em> view</h3>

<p>This feature works together with the launch configurations to make the process of running regression tests on your grammars quick and easy. As described in the <a href="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/gf-book/">GF Book</a> (Section 10.5), the general development-test cycle (independent of GFEP) is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a file <code>test.trees</code> which contains a bunch of abstract syntax trees, which you want to test</li>
<li>Compile your grammar and linearise the trees one by one, using some command like <code>rf -lines -tree -file=test.trees | l -table | wf -file=test.trees.out</code></li>
<li>Manually correct the output in <code>test.trees.out</code> and save it as your gold standard file <code>test.trees.gold</code>.</li>
<li>Each time you update your grammar, repeat step 2, then compare your new output against the gold standard using <code>diff</code> or some other comparison tool.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <strong>Test Manager</strong> view follows this same pattern but provides a convenient graphical interface for running your test cases and also for looking at the output, just using a few clicks:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/images/eclipse-test-manager.png" alt="Test Manager view" /></p>

<p>Note that GFEP assumes the following convention:</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>*.trees</code> or <code>*.sentences</code></dt>
<dd>Test input files: trees file (for testing linearisation) and sentences file (for testing parsing)</dd>

<dt><code>*.trees.out</code> or <code>*.sentences.out</code></dt>
<dd>Corresponding output files (generated each time a test is run)</dd>

<dt><code>*.trees.gold</code> or <code>*.sentences.gold</code></dt>
<dd>Corresponding gold standard files (manually corrected from an output file)</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Logs</h3>

<p>The GFEP writes to the Eclipse platform log. This can be accessed in two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>By opening the <strong>Error Log</strong> view in Eclipse</li>
<li>Accessing the file directly at <code>&lt;workspace&gt;/.metadata/.log</code></li>
</ol>

<p>You can set the log verbosity from <strong>Preferences &rarr; Grammatical Framework</strong>.</p>

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h2>Common issues and fixes</h2>

<h3>No identifiers are resolved and my log contains messages saying &#8220;File Syntax.gf does not exist.&#8221;</h3>

<p>In general, this means that something is wrong with your <em>library path</em> setting.</p>

<p>GFEP attempts to compile all of your files individually with GF, which is not the usual way in which you would compile your grammar.
As a result, when looking for the RGL files, GF needs a little help via the <code>path</code> argument.</p>

<p>The normal way to do this is to specify the <em>Library path</em> setting from  <strong>Preferences &rarr; Grammatical Framework</strong>, setting it to something like <code>.:alltenses:prelude</code> (this is the default setting). Note that these paths are relative to the true RGL directory, which GF should already be aware of. The value of this setting is passed to GF from GFEP using the <code>--path</code> flag.</p>

<p>The <em>Library path</em> setting is the same for all your GF projects. If you want finer-grain control over the <code>path</code> compiler option then you should use compiler pragmas in your source files, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>--# -path=.:alltenses:prelude
</code></pre>

<p>The advantage of this method is that the information is bound to the file, so you can freely compile your modules outside of GFEP without having to specify the path as a command line option to GF.
The disadvantage is that you need to specify such a pragma in every single file (at least if you want to continue to use the GFEP).</p>

<h3>Other strange behaviour</h3>

<p>When things seem strange, the very first step is always to clean the project via <strong>Project &rarr; Clean&#8230;</strong>.
I only support the latest version of the plugin, so make sure you are up to date too.</p>

<p>If problems persist, please contact me or better yet file an issue on the GitHub issue tracker (see below).</p>

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h2>For developers</h2>

<h3>Project setup</h3>

<p>In order to build/run the GFEP from source, you need to have the Xtext libraries available in your Eclipse workspace. You have two choices:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the Xtext libraries from <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/download/">http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/download/</a> and add them to your existing Eclipse instance</li>
<li>Download a release of Eclipse packaged together with Xtext from <a href="http://xtext.itemis.com/xtext/language=en/36553/downloads">http://xtext.itemis.com/xtext/language=en/36553/downloads</a></li>
</ol>

<p>In both cases make sure you get the correct version of Xtext (see below).
Once you have Xtext set up, you can clone the repository locally with <code>git clone git://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-eclipse-plugin.git</code> and then add the projects under the <code>workspace</code> directory to your Eclipse workspace.</p>

<h4>Xtext version</h4>

<p>GFEP currently uses <strong>Xtext 2.1.0</strong>.</p>

<h3>Running from source</h3>

<p>Once you have set up your projects (see above), you can run/debug the GFEP by following the steps <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/2_1_0/020-domainmodel-step-by-step.php#DomainmodelWalkThrough_7">here</a>.
Note that this means you will be running <em>two</em> instances of Eclipse simultaneously; the first debugging the second.</p>

<h3>Building plugin package</h3>

<p>To package the GFEP sources as <code>.jar</code> files and install/update the GFEP in a separate Eclipse installation, do the following:</p>

<ol>
