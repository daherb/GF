<p><em>The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union&#8217;s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement nÂ° FP7-ICT-247914.</em></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The aim behind developing a desktop IDE for GF is to provide more powerful tools than may be possible and/or practical in a web-based environment (the GF Web IDE). In particular, the ability to resolve identifier cross-references and browse external libraries quickly during development time is one of the primary motivations for the project.</p>

<p>The choice was made to develop this desktop IDE as a plugin for the Eclipse Platform as it emerged as the most popular choice among the GF developer community. Support for the platform is vast and many tools for adapting Eclipse to domain-specific languages already exist. Unlike the zero-click Web IDE approach, using the GF Eclipse plugin (GFEP) will require some manual installation and configuration on the development machine. Thus the GFEP is aimed more at seasoned developers rather than the curious GF newbie.</p>

<p>The starting point for the GFEP is using the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/">Xtext DSL Framework</a> for Eclipse. By converting the GF grammar into the appropriate Extended-BNF form required by the LL(*) ANTLR parser, the framework provides a good starting point for future plugin development, already including a variery of syntax checking tools and some cross-reference resolution support. The specific requirements of the GF language, particularly in the way of its special module hierarchy, mean that significant customisations to this generated base plugin are needed.</p>

<p>The GFEP is being developed by  as part of Work Package 2 of the <a href="http://www.molto-project.eu/">MOLTO Project</a>.</p>

<h2>Installation &amp; updating</h2>

<h3>System requirements</h3>

<ol>
<li>The plugin makes use of the newest GF features, and <strong>requires the latest developer version of GF</strong> to be installed on your system (instructions <a href="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/download/index.html">here</a>).</li>
<li>Paths to GF must be set within the plugin (see below). This means:

<ul>
<li>you don&#8217;t necessarily need to have GF in your <code>PATH</code> environment variable</li>
<li>you can use a separate GF installation for GFEP if you wish</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The plugin was developed using Eclipse 3.7. It has been successfully installed on Eclipse as low as 3.6.2.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Installing the plugin for the first time</h3>

<p><strong>Note about Available Software Sites</strong></p>

<p>In order for dependencies to be satisfied, you need to ensure that your Eclipse has the following update site URLs set:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eclipse releases (change version number to match): <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/3.7/">http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/3.7/</a></li>
<li>Xtext: <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/tmf/xtext/updates/composite/releases/">http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/tmf/xtext/updates/composite/releases/</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Steps for installation</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Inside Eclipse, go to <strong>Help &rarr; Install New Software</strong>.</li>
<li>Add new software site using the URL: <code>http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/release/</code></li>
<li>Select the <strong>GF Eclipse Plugin</strong>, and make sure the option <em>Contact all update sites during install to find required software</em> is checked.</li>
<li>Click Next, accept the license agreement and install.</li>
<li>Accept the prompt warning that the software is unsigned.</li>
<li>Restart Eclipse when prompted.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note when installing on Ubuntu:</strong>
If you installed the Eclipse package from Ubuntu&#8217;s Software Centre you may find that your update site list is empty, as described by <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/eclipse/+bug/460944">this bug</a>. This will cause the GFEP installation to fail; You will need to add the standard Eclipse update site URL manually, e.g. <code>http://download.eclipse.org/releases/indigo/</code></p>

<h4>Settings</h4>

<ol>
<li>Add the GF perspective by clicking <strong>Open Perspective &rarr; Other</strong> and choosing <strong>GF</strong>.</li>
<li>Set your paths to the GF executable and libraries by going to <strong>Window &rarr; Preferences &rarr; Grammatical Framework</strong>.<br />
<em>The runtime path is assumed to be <code>~/.cabal/bin/gf</code>, which may be wrong depending on your
system and how you installed GF.</em><br />
<em>The library path should get automatically set from your environment&#8217;s <code>GF_LIB_PATH</code> variable.</em></li>
<li>You can also adjust the verbosity level of the GFEP logger.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Updating the plugin</h3>

<ol>
<li>In Eclipse, go to <strong>Help &rarr; Check for updates</strong>.</li>
<li>Any available updates will appear in the dialog. Select them and follow the usual steps.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Upgrading to GFEP 1.2.3</h4>

<ul>
<li>If your project has a folder named <code>(External)</code> you can safely delete this <strong>via the Eclipse Project Explorer</strong>. It is no longer used in GFEP >= 1.2.3</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>Some steps you can follow to get a feel of of the plugin&#8217;s features.</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a new <strong>GF Project</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/images/eclipse-projectwizard-1.png" alt="New project wizard" />
<img src="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/images/eclipse-projectwizard-2.png" alt="New project wizard" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Create some new modules using the <strong>GF Module</strong> wizard from <strong>File &rarr; New &rarr; Other &rarr; GF Module</strong>:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/images/eclipse-modulewizard-1.png" alt="New module wizard" /></p>

<p><em>If asked whether you want to add the <strong>Xtext nature</strong> to your project, you can safely say <strong>No</strong> (this prompt has been removed in newer versions).</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can find some small examples at <a href="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/examples/">http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/examples/</a>. Download the 
files and manually add them to your Eclipse workspace to experiment with some of the plugin features.</p></li>
<li><p>You can change your syntax colouring styles as you wish from <strong>Window &rarr; Preferences &rarr; Grammatical Framework &rarr; Syntax Coloring</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/images/eclipse-syntaxcoloring.png" alt="Syntax highlighting styles" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Use Eclipes&#8217; own features to drag and drop your editor tabs to suit your needs. Notice the <strong>Outline</strong> view in the bottom-right offers a quite overview of your module structure. Clicking any of the terms will make your cursor jump to that point in the file.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/images/eclipse-editor-general.png" alt="The editor and outline view" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Note how changing a <code>cat</code> definition for example will produce warnings and/or errors in other the modules.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/images/eclipse-editor-cat.png" alt="Warnings and errors in the editor" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Use the built-in code formatter to tidy your code automatically. Right-click in the editor and choose <strong>Format</strong> or use the keyboard shortcut <strong>Ctrl+Shift+F</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/images/eclipse-before-format.png" alt="Before auto-formatting" /> <img src="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/images/eclipse-after-format.png" alt="After auto-formatting" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Set up a launch configuration from <strong>Run &rarr; Run Configurations&#8230; &rarr; Grammatical Framework</strong>. You will see the dialog below with some fields automatically filled in for you. </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/images/eclipse-launchconfig.png" alt="Launch configuration dialog" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Run the launch config and you will see the output from the GF compiler in the console view within Eclipse.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Usage hints &amp; issues</h3>

<h4>Consoles</h4>

<p>The plugin provides its own console view named <em>GFEP Log</em>, which shows log messages based on the <strong>Log Level</strong> preference (<strong>Window &rarr; Preferences &rarr; Grammatical Framework</strong>).</p>

<p>Additionally, everytime a grammar is <strong>Run</strong> a <em>new</em> console is opened to display the output. This console may also serve as the interactive GF Shell, depending on the <strong>Interactive Mode</strong> checkbox in your <strong>Run Configuration</strong>.</p>

<p>Eclipse does not make it obvious when multiple console windows open; click on the <strong>Display Selected Console</strong> button to switch between open consoles:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/images/eclipse-console-icon.png" alt="Display Selected Console icon" /></p>

<p><em>The Eclipse console implementation does not support command history (up arrow) or auto-completion (tab).</em></p>

<h4>Logs</h4>

<p>You can set the log verbosity from <strong>Window &rarr; Preferences &rarr; Grammatical Framework</strong>. This setting also affects the verbosity of the log file <code>gfep.log</code>.</p>

<h4>Validation</h4>

<p>For validation to work correctly, the project&#8217;s <strong>Build Automatically</strong> option should be turned on.</p>

<p>The in-editor validation sometimes needs to be triggered/updated by a keystroke. If you can still see errors which you believe should be correct, try adding a space character to ensure the validation is re-triggered.</p>

<p>Sometimes you may get an entire file marked with errors, even though in fact there is only a single error which is causing the internal builder to fail. In such cases referring to the <strong>Problems</strong> view should help you locate the cause. This issue is particularly relevant when changes made to one module may induce errors in its descendants (e.g. renaming a parameter in a resource module). This behaviour will hopefully be improved in future versions.</p>
