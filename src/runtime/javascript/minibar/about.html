<h1>About Minibar</h1>

<a href="minibar.html">Minibar</a> is an alternative implementation of the
<a href="http://www.grammaticalframework.org:41296/fridge/">Fridge Poetry web app</a>.
It doesn't do everything the original Fridge Poetry does (e.g. drag-and-drop is missing),
so I refer to it as a minibar rather than a full refrigerator :-)

<p>
Some implementation details:

<ul class=space>
  <li>It is implemented directly in JavaScipt. It does not use Google Web Toolkit or any big JavaScript libraries.
  <li>It has been tested and found to work in the following browsers:
  <ul>
    <li>On the Mac: Firefox 3.5 &amp; 3.6, Safari 4.0, Opera 10.10 and
    Google Chrome 4.0.249.49.
    <li>On Linux: Firefox 3.0.18 & 3.5, Opera 10.10.
    <li>On the Android Dev Phone: Android Mobile Safari 3.0.4 & 3.1.2
    and Android Opera Mini 4.2.
  </ul>
  It does not seem work in Internet Explorer 7
  (there are both styling and scripting issues).
  <li>The implementation consist of two JavaScript files:
  <a href="minibar.js">minibar.js</a> (186 lines)
  and <a href="support.js">support.js</a> (147 lines).
  The latter is also used in a small web app based on the
  <a href="http://spraakbanken.gu.se/sal/ws/">SALDO web services</a>.
  <li>To access the GF web service, it uses the
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#JSONP">JSONP method</a>
  mentioned in the GF
  web services paper, which allows the web app to be hosted on a different server
  from the GF web service. (To demonstrate this, I put the Minibar demo on
  www.cs.chalmers.se, while the GF server that it calls is on
  www.grammaticalframework.org.)
  <li>As an experiment, it does no use the <code>grammars.xml</code> file,
  but instead calls a little CGI script,
  <a href="http://www.grammaticalframework.org:41296/grammars/grammars.cgi.txt">grammars.cgi</a>
  which lists the .pgf in the directory, in JSONP format. (Note: if you want to install
  this on your own computer,
  <ul>
    <li>if you click on the link,
        the CGI script will be downloaded as <code>grammars.cgi.txt</code>,
        but it should be called <code>grammars.cgi</code> and stored on the server
        in the same directory as the grammar files.
    <li>for CGI scripts to work with lighttpd, <code>"mod_cgi"</code> needs to be included
    in the definition of <code>server.modules</code> in the
    <code>lighttpd.conf</code> file.)
  </ul>
  <li>[Added 2010-02-16] There is a button for generating random sentences.
  <li>[Added 2010-02-23] All translations are shown, not just the first one, if there are
  multiple parses.
  <li>[Added 2010-02-25] Next to each translation, there is now a little tree icon that
  you can click on to see a drawing of an abstract syntax tree or a parse tree. If you click
  on a drawing it collapses back into a tree icon.
</ul>
