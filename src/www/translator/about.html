<h1><a href="../"><img src="../P/gf-cloud.png" alt="" title="GF Cloud Service"></a>About the Simple Translation Tool</h1>

<p>

<a href="./">This</a> is a simple bilingual document editor. Documents consist
of a sequence of segments that are translated independently. The user can import
text in the source language and obtain automatically translated text in the
target language. Imported text can be segmented based on punctuation.
Optionally, one can also use line breaks or blank lines to indicate segmentation
in imported text. Text can be edited after it has been imported.

<p>If an unsatisfactory automatic translation is
obtained, the user can click on it and replace it with a manual translation.
If multiple translations are obtained, one of them is shown by default and
the other ones are available in a popup menu.
<p>
The GF web service is used for automatic translation. The user picks which
grammar to use from a menu of available grammars. Through menu options,
the user also sets the source and target language for the document.

<p>
The tool handles a set of documents. Documents can be named, saved,
closed and reopened later. Documents can be saved locally or in the cloud.

<h2>TODO</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Text can be imported/exported by copying and pasting, but other ways
  could be added.
  <li>GF's lexer/unlexer is used to allow for more natural looking text, but
  the unlexer does the wrong thing if the first word of a sentence is supposed
  to be capitalized, e.g. "I am ready." and "Spanish wine is good."
  <li>Document sharing in the cloud.
  <li>Interface to other translation services.
  <li>Interface to the grammar editor for grammar extension.
  <li>More browser compatibility testing (Chrome,  Firefox &amp; Safari tested
  so far).
  <li>...
  <li>...
</ul>
