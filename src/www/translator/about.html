<h1>About the Simple Translation Tool</h1>

<p>
This is a simple bilingual document editor. Documents consist of a sequence
of segments that are translated independently. The user can add segments
in the source language and obtain automatically translated segments in
the target language. If an unsatisfactory automatic translation is
obtained, the user can click on it and replace it with a manual translation.

<p>
The GF web service is used for automatic translation. The user picks which
grammar to use from a menu of available grammars. Through menu options,
the user also sets the source and target language for the document.

<p>
The tool handles a set of documents. Documents can be named, saved (locally),
closed and reopened later.

<h2>TODO</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Test for browser compatibility (Safari &amp; Firefox tested so far).
  <li>GF' lexer/unlexer is used to allow for more natural looking text, but
  the unlexer does the wrong thing if the first word of a sentence is supposed
  to be capitalized, e.g. "I am ready." and "Spanish wine is good."
  <li>Import/export text.
  <li>Cloud service.
  <li>Interface to other translation services.
  <li>Interface to grammar editor for grammar extension.
  <li>...
