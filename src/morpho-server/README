Note, some paths are still hardcoded in MorphoServer.hs, you have to
change them before compiling.

See ../server/README for requirements and installation instructions
(replace gf.fcgi with gf-morpho.fcgi).

To build (doesn't yet use Cabal, since it needs some modules not yet in 
the gf Cabal package):

$ make

When installed, try for example (change URL as appropriate):

http://localhost/~bringert/morpho-server/gf-morpho.fcgi/eval?term=mkN+%22talo%22

This will output a JSON representation of the resulting inflection table.
The JSON representation should be changed, I've noticed that it's much nicer
to have fixed object field names in JSON when using GWT. Perhaps the format
should be:

[[key, value]]
