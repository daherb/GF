== Requirements ==

- cabal
  * See quick installation instructions at the bottom of 
     http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/wiki/CabalInstall

- FastCGI development kit
  * MacPorts: sudo port install fcgi

- Haskell packages: fastcgi, json, utf8-string
  * cabal install fastcgi json utf8-string

- GF installed as a Cabal package
   * (cd ../.. && cabal install)
   * Maybe need to remove "-beta" from the Version field in ../../GF.cabal

== Building ==

- Build gf.fcgi

$ make

- Build small example grammar:

$ make food

== Running ==

- Make sure that your web server supports FastCGI.

- Make sure that your web server knows that gf.fcgi is a FastCGI
program.

- Make sure that you are allowed to run FastCGI programs in the 
directory that you use.

- With large grammars, gf.fcgi may take long enough to start that the web server
thinks that the program has died. With Apache, you can fix this by adding 
"FastCgiConfig -startDelay 30" to your httpd.conf. 

These sections from my Apache config fixes the above two:

(On OS X, this is in /etc/httpd/httpd.conf)

LoadModule fastcgi_module     libexec/httpd/mod_fastcgi.so
AddModule mod_fastcgi.c

<IfModule mod_fastcgi.c> 
  FastCgiIpcDir /tmp/fcgi_ipc/ 
  AddHandler fastcgi-script .fcgi 
  FastCgiConfig -startDelay 30
</IfModule>


(On OS X, this is in /etc/httpd/users/bringert.conf)

<Directory "/Users/bringert/Sites/">
    Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymlinks ExecCGI
    AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
    AllowOverride None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>


- Copy or symlink this directory to your web directory.

- First test from the command-line, since debugging is harder from the AJAX UI:

$ curl 'http://localhost/~bringert/gf-server/gf.fcgi/translate?input=this+fish&cat=Item&from=FoodEng'

- Check server logs (e.g. /var/log/httpd/error_log) if it doesn't work.

- Go to SERVER_URL/gf-client.html in your web browser.
