To make and install GF2 (Version 2.1, 8/11/2004).

1. Unpack GF2 and go to the source directory (the place where this 
   INSTALL file is - so you have probably done this already!)

     tar xvfz GF-2.1.tgz
     cd GF-2.1/src

2. Make sure you have GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler), version 5.02 or later.
   In Windows, you also need Cygwin.

     ghc --version

3. If you are building from CVS, run autoconf (in src/):

     autoconf

4. Run configure

     ./configure

   If you want to install the GF somewhere other than /usr/local, use
   the --prefix flag. E.g.

     ./configure --prefix=/usr

   To compile on Chalmers Solaris systems using VCS, use this configuration:

     ./configure CPPFLAGS="`lib__readline -I` `lib__ncurses -I`" LDFLAGS="`lib__readline -l` `lib__ncurses -l`"

   If you experience problems with readline, try:

   ./configure --with-readline=no
   
   You may need to run "make clean" after ./configure when you change the 
   readline setting.


5. Compile with make:

     make

   The binary is sent to the file GF/bin/gf

6. For a quick test: load a grammar package from

     http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~aarne/GF/download/gf-lib.tgz

   Open the package under GF-2.0

     tar xvfz gf-lib.tgz

   Then start gf, load a grammar and parse a string:

     cd ../lib/basic
     ../../bin/gf English.gf

     -- when gf has started and shows the prompt >:
     > p "every number is even or odd"
     -- this is the response from GF2:
     PredA1 (Every Number) (DisjA1 Even Odd)

7. If you want to run the Java GUI, go back to GF2/src and also do

     make install-java

   Then edit the file GF2/bin/jgf by changing
   the value of GFHOME to the location of your GF2/bin directory. Test the
   GUI with some grammars:

     cd ../lib/letter
     ../../bin/gf <mkLetter.gfs
     ../../bin/jgf Letter.gfcm

   When the window opens, push the Random button.
